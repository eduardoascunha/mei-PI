#   MEI-PI | Text-to-SQL vs LLM's 
Master's Degree in Computer Engineering - Computer Engineering Project

This work investigates the evolution of Text-to-SQL systems, tracing the transition from traditional SQL querying to modern AI-driven approaches powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)

This repo is the final aggregation of the repositories created during the development of this work.

`/level1` -  Basic Text-to-SQL, where natural language is translated into SQL queries.

`/level2` - Context-Aware SQL Generation, which incorporates schema and domain knowledge for improved accuracy.

`/level3` - Direct Data Access, where LLMs interact with structured data through retrieval-based or semantic methods instead of generating SQL

`/docs` - Survey and Final Presentation

`/tpc-c-kit` - TPC-C Benchmark
 
`/tpc-h-kit` - TPC-H Benchmark
