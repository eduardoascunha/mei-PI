Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how the market share of a given nation within a given region has changed over two years  for a given part type.
The  market  share  for  a  given  nation  within  a  given  region  is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  the  revenue,  the  sum  of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'KENYA'
2. REGION is the value defined in Clause 4.2.3 for R_NAME where R_REGIONKEY corresponds to N_REGIONKEY for the selected NATION in item 1 above; In this case assume REGION 'AFRICA'
3. TYPE is randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume TYPE 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "corresponds to n_regionkey", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "given part type", columns [lineitem.l_partkey, part.p_partkey, part.p_type] may be used.
According to "l_discount from the", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "of l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "r_name where r_regionkey corresponds", columns [region.r_name] may be used.
According to "r_regionkey corresponds to", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers from the given", columns [supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "this order", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderdate, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "to n_regionkey", columns [customer.c_nationkey, nation.n_regionkey] may be used.
Values [1995-01-01, 1996-12-31, AFRICA, ECONOMY PLATED BRASS, KENYA] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_year,
	sum(case
		when nation = 'KENYA' then volume
		else 0
	end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share
from
	(
		select
			extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,
			n2.n_name as nation
		from
			part,
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			orders,
			customer,
			nation n1,
			nation n2,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = l_partkey
			and s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and o_custkey = c_custkey
			and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
			and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'AFRICA'
			and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
			and o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
			and p_type = 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'
	) as all_nations
group by
	o_year
order by
	o_year;

QUESTION:
This query determines the value of goods shipped between certain nations to help in the  re-negotiation of shipping 
contracts. 
The Volume  Shipping Query finds, for two given nations, the  gross discounted revenues derived from lineitems in which parts  were  shipped from a  supplier in either nation to a  customer in the  other nation during 1995 and 1996. The query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the revenue from shipments that took place  in that year. The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION1 'ARGENTINA'
2. NATION2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3 and must be different from the value selected for NATION1 in item 1 above. In this case assume NATION2 'KENYA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "customer nation the", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "derived from lineitems in", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "from lineitems in", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "lineitems in", columns [lineitem.l_discount, lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_suppkey] may be used.

According to "supplier in", columns [supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier nation", columns [supplier.s_nationkey] may be used.
Values [1995-01-01, 1996-12-31, ARGENTINA, KENYA] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,
	l_year,
	sum(volume) as revenue
from
	(
		select
			n1.n_name as supp_nation,

			and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
			and c_custkey = o_custkey
			and s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
			and c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
			and (
				(n1.n_name = 'ARGENTINA' and n2.n_name = 'KENYA')
				or (n1.n_name = 'KENYA' and n2.n_name = 'ARGENTINA')
			)
			and l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
	) as shipping
group by

QUESTION:
The Potential Part Promotion Query identifies suppliers in a particular nation having selected parts that may be candidates for a promotional offer.
The  Potential Part Promotion  query identifies suppliers  who have an excess of a  given part available; an excess is defined  to  be  more  than  50%  of  the  parts  like  the  given  part  that  the  supplier shipped  in  a  given  year  for  a  given nation. Only parts whose names share a certain naming convention are considered.
Substitution Parameters:
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME. In this case assume COLOR 'brown%'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within 1993..1997. In this case assume DATE '1994-01-01'
3. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'SAUDI ARABIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given nation", columns [nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "given part available", columns [partsupp.ps_availqty] may be used.
According to "identifies suppliers in a", columns [supplier.s_name] may be used.
According to "nation only", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "p_name in this case", columns [part.p_name] may be used.

Values [0.5, 1, 1994-01-01, SAUDI ARABIA, brown%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_name,
	s_address
from
	supplier,
	nation
where
	s_suppkey in (
		select
			ps_suppkey
		from
			partsupp
		where
			ps_partkey in (
				select
					p_partkey
				from
					part
				where
					p_name like 'brown%'
			)
			and ps_availqty > (
				select
					0.5 * sum(l_quantity)
				from
					lineitem
				where
					l_partkey = ps_partkey
					and l_suppkey = ps_suppkey
					and l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
					and l_shipdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
			)
	)
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
order by

Values [0.0001000000, UNITED STATES] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	ps_partkey,
	sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as value
from
	partsupp,
	supplier,
	nation
where
	ps_suppkey = s_suppkey

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "date orders", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "date orders are listed", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "l_discount of", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.

According to "orders with the highest", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
Values [1995-03-27, FURNITURE] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_orderkey,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE'
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate < date '1995-03-27'
	and l_shipdate > date '1995-03-27'
group by
	l_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
order by
	revenue desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 10;

QUESTION:
This query determines how much profit is made on a given line of parts, broken out by supplier nation and year.
The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the  sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount))  -  (ps_supplycost  * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the  year 
and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume COLOR '%red%'

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
