Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query retrieves the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value.
The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SEGMENT is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Segments in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume segment 'FURNITURE'
2. DATE is a randomly selected day within [1995-03-01 .. 1995-03-31]. In this case assume dates '1995-03-27', '1995-03-27'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "date orders", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "date orders are listed", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "l_discount of", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "of l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "orders are listed in", columns [orders.o_shippriority] may be used.
According to "orders with", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "orders with the highest", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
Values [1995-03-27, FURNITURE] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_orderkey,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE'
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate < date '1995-03-27'
	and l_shipdate > date '1995-03-27'
group by
	l_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
order by
	revenue desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 10;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
The query identifies customers who might be having problems with the parts that are shipped to them.
The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter,  who  have  returned  parts.  The  query  considers  only  parts  that  were  ordered  in  the  specified  quarter.  The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. DATE is the first day of a randomly selected month from the second month of 1993 to the first month of 1995. In this case assume DATE '1993-08-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "address nation", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "comment information and", columns [customer.c_comment] may be used.
According to "customer s name", columns [customer.c_name, customer.c_phone] may be used.
According to "customer s name address", columns [customer.c_acctbal, customer.c_address, customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "l_discount for", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "lineitems substitution", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_returnflag] may be used.
According to "name address nation", columns [customer.c_nationkey, nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "order of", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderdate, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
Values [1993-08-01, 3, R] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	c_acctbal,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_phone,
	c_comment
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	nation
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate >= date '1993-08-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1993-08-01' + interval '3' month
	and l_returnflag = 'R'
	and c_nationkey = n_nationkey
group by
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	c_acctbal,
	c_phone,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_comment
order by
	revenue desc
limit 20;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines the top supplier so it can be rewarded, given more business, or identified for special recognition.
The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during a  given  quarter  of  a  given  year.  In  case  of  a  tie,  the  query lists  all  suppliers  whose  contribution  was  equal  to  the maximum, presented in supplier number order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the 10th  month of 1997. In this case assume DATE '1997-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "shipped during a given", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "supplier number", columns [supplier.s_phone, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier query finds the", columns [supplier.s_address, supplier.s_name] may be used.
Values [1997-01-01, 3] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
create view revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) as
	select
		l_suppkey,
		sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
	from
		lineitem
	where
		l_shipdate >= date '1997-01-01'
		and l_shipdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	group by
		l_suppkey;


select
	s_suppkey,
	s_name,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	total_revenue
from
	supplier,
	revenue0
where
	s_suppkey = supplier_no
	and total_revenue = (
		select
			max(total_revenue)
		from
			revenue0
	)
order by
	s_suppkey;

drop view revenue0;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This query monitors the market response to a promotion such as TV advertisements or a special campaign.
The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)). 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first day of a month randomly selected from a random year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-04-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "as l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "parts the", columns [part.p_partkey, part.p_type] may be used.
According to "shipped in that month", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
Values [1, 100.00, 1996-04-01, PROMO%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	100.00 * sum(case
		when p_type like 'PROMO%'
			then l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
		else 0
	end) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	l_partkey = p_partkey
	and l_shipdate >= date '1996-04-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1996-04-01' + interval '1' month;

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
This query lists the revenue volume done through local suppliers.
The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions  in  which  the  customer  ordering  parts  and  the  supplier  filling  them  were  both  within  that  nation.  The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given  year. The  query displays  the  nations and revenue  volume  in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1  - l_discount)).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in C;aise 4.2.3; In this case assume REGION 'EUROPE'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume 1994-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "l_extendedprice 1", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.

QUESTION:
This query reports the amount of business that was billed, shipped, and returned. 
The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped as of a given date. The  date  is  within  60  -  120  days  of  the  greatest  ship  date  contained  in  the  database.  The  query  lists  totals  for extended  price,  discounted  extended  price,  discounted  extended  price  plus  tax,  average  quantity,  average  extended price,  and  average  discount.  These  aggregates  are  grouped  by  RETURNFLAG  and  LINESTATUS,  and  listed  in  ascending  order  of  RETURNFLAG  and  LINESTATUS.  A  count  of  the  number  of  lineitems  in  each  group  is included. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:  
1. DELTA is randomly selected within [60. 120]. In this case assume DELTA = '84 days'
Comment: 1998-12-01 is the highest possible ship date as defined in the database population. (This is ENDDATE - 30).  The  query  will  include  all  lineitems  shipped  before  this  date  minus  DELTA  days.  The  intent  is  to  choose DELTA so that between 95% and 97% of the rows in the table are scanned.
