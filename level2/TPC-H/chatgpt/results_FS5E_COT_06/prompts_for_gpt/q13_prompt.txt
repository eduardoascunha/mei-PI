Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  finds  out  how  many  suppliers  can  supply  parts  with  given  attributes.  It  might  be  used,  for  example,  to 
determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts. 
The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes as long as they are not of a given type, not of a given brand, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = Brand#MN where M and N are two single character strings representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#42'
2. TYPE is made of the  first 2 syllables of a string randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume TYPE 'LARGE PLATED%'
3. SIZE1 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE1 = 9
4. SIZE2 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE2 = 7
5. SIZE3 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE3 = 14
6. SIZE4 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE4 = 41
7. SIZE5 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE5 = 43
8. SIZE6 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE6 = 38
9. SIZE7 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE7 = 23
10. SIZE8 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]. In this case assume SIZE8 = 34

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "parts with", columns [part.p_brand, part.p_partkey, part.p_type, partsupp.ps_partkey, partsupp.ps_suppkey] may be used.
According to "size substitution parameters values", columns [part.p_size] may be used.
According to "supplier who", columns [supplier.s_comment, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
Values [%Customer%Complaints%, 14, 23, 34, 38, 41, 43, 7, 9, Brand#42, LARGE PLATED%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size,
	count(distinct ps_suppkey) as supplier_cnt
from
	partsupp,
	part
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and p_brand <> 'Brand#42'
	and p_type not like 'LARGE PLATED%'
	and p_size in (9, 7, 14, 41, 43, 38, 23, 34)
	and ps_suppkey not in (
		select
			s_suppkey
		from
			supplier
		where
			s_comment like '%Customer%Complaints%'
	)
group by
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size
order by
	supplier_cnt desc,
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
The  Large  Volume  Customer  Query  ranks  customers  based  on  their  having  placed  a  large  quantity  order.  Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level.
The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [312..315]. In this case assume QUANTITY = 314

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "customer key the", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "customer name customer", columns [customer.c_name] may be used.
According to "key the order key", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order key", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order key date", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "orders whose total", columns [orders.o_totalprice] may be used.
According to "text 1 quantity is", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
Values [314] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice,
	sum(l_quantity)
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey in (
		select
			l_orderkey
		from
			lineitem
		group by
			l_orderkey having
				sum(l_quantity) > 314
	)
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
group by
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice
order by
	o_totalprice desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 100;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  determines  how  much  average  yearly  revenue  would  be  lost  if  orders  were  no longer  filled  for  small quantities of certain parts. This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments.
The  Small-Quantity-Order  Revenue  Query  considers  parts  of  a  given  brand  and  with  a given  container  type  and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7 -year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = 'Brand#MN' where MN is a  two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#23'
2. CONTAINER  is  randomly  selected  within  the  list  of  2-syllable  strings  defined  for Containers  in  Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume CONTAINER 'SM CAN'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given container type", columns [part.p_container] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice, lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity of", columns [lineitem.l_partkey] may be used.
According to "parts with", columns [part.p_brand, part.p_partkey] may be used.
Values [0.2, 7.0, Brand#23, SM CAN] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_yearly
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	p_partkey = l_partkey
	and p_brand = 'Brand#23'
	and p_container = 'SM CAN'
	and l_quantity < (
		select
			0.2 * avg(l_quantity)
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_partkey = p_partkey
	);

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how well the order priority system is working and gives an assessment of customer satisfaction.
The Order Priority Checking Query counts the number of orders ordered in a given quarter of a given year in which at least one lineitem  was received by the  customer later than its committed date. The  query lists the  count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the  10th  month  of 1997. In this case assume date '1997-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "lineitem was", columns [lineitem.l_commitdate] may be used.
According to "lineitem was received by", columns [lineitem.l_receiptdate] may be used.
According to "of orders ordered", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "of orders ordered in", columns [orders.o_orderpriority] may be used.
According to "one lineitem", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
According to "orders ordered in a", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
Values [1997-01-01, 3] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_orderpriority,
	count(*) as order_count
from
	orders
where
	o_orderdate >= date '1997-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	)
group by
	o_orderpriority
order by
	o_orderpriority;

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
The Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase.
This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years but  who  have  a  greater  than  average  “positive”  account  balance.  It  also  reflects  the magnitude  of  that  balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone. 
Substitution Parameters: 
1. I1 ... I7 are randomly selected without repetition from the possible values for Country code as defined in Clause 4.2.2.9. In this case assume ('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "c_phone substitution", columns [customer.c_phone] may be used.
According to "customers who", columns [customer.c_acctbal] may be used.
According to "orders for", columns [orders.o_custkey] may be used.
According to "two characters of c_phone", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
Values [0.00, 10, 2, 21, 26, 28, 30, 31, 33] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	cntrycode,
	count(*) as numcust,
	sum(c_acctbal) as totacctbal
from
	(
		select
			substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) as cntrycode,
			c_acctbal
		from
			customer
		where
			substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in
				('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')
			and c_acctbal > (
				select
					avg(c_acctbal)
				from
					customer
				where
					c_acctbal > 0.00
					and substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in
						('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')
			)
			and not exists (
				select
					*
				from
					orders
				where
					o_custkey = c_custkey
			)
	) as custsale
group by
	cntrycode
order by
	cntrycode;

QUESTION:
This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. 
This query determines  the  distribution of customers by  the  number of orders they have  made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern. 
Substitution Parameters:
1. WORD1 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: special, pending, unusual, express. In this case assume WORD1 unusual
2. WORD2 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: packages, requests, accounts, deposits. In this case assume WORD2 accounts

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
