Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_acctbal,
	s_name,
	n_name,
	p_partkey,
	p_mfgr,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	s_comment
from
	part,
	supplier,
	partsupp,
	nation,
	region
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
	and p_size = 2
	and p_type like '%TIN'
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'ASIA'
	and ps_supplycost = (
		select
			min(ps_supplycost)
		from
			partsupp,
			supplier,
			nation,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = ps_partkey
			and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'ASIA'
	)
order by
	s_acctbal desc,
	n_name,
	s_name,
	p_partkey
limit 100;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how well the order priority system is working and gives an assessment of customer satisfaction.
The Order Priority Checking Query counts the number of orders ordered in a given quarter of a given year in which at least one lineitem  was received by the  customer later than its committed date. The  query lists the  count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the  10th  month  of 1997. In this case assume date '1997-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_orderpriority,
	count(*) as order_count
from
	orders
where
	o_orderdate >= date '1997-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	)
group by
	o_orderpriority
order by
	o_orderpriority;

QUESTION:
This query determines the top supplier so it can be rewarded, given more business, or identified for special recognition.
The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during a  given  quarter  of  a  given  year.  In  case  of  a  tie,  the  query lists  all  suppliers  whose  contribution  was  equal  to  the maximum, presented in supplier number order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the 10th  month of 1997. In this case assume DATE '1997-01-01'
