Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  finds  out  how  many  suppliers  can  supply  parts  with  given  attributes.  It  might  be  used,  for  example,  to 
determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts. 
The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes as long as they are not of a given type, not of a given brand, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = Brand#MN where M and N are two single character strings representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#42'
2. TYPE is made of the  first 2 syllables of a string randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume TYPE 'LARGE PLATED%'
3. SIZE1 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE1 = 9
4. SIZE2 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE2 = 7
5. SIZE3 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE3 = 14
6. SIZE4 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE4 = 41
7. SIZE5 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE5 = 43
8. SIZE6 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE6 = 38
9. SIZE7 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE7 = 23
10. SIZE8 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]. In this case assume SIZE8 = 34

SQL QUERY:
select
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size,
	count(distinct ps_suppkey) as supplier_cnt
from
	partsupp,
	part
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and p_brand <> 'Brand#42'
	and p_type not like 'LARGE PLATED%'
	and p_size in (9, 7, 14, 41, 43, 38, 23, 34)
	and ps_suppkey not in (
		select
			s_suppkey
		from
			supplier
		where
			s_comment like '%Customer%Complaints%'
	)
group by
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size
order by
	supplier_cnt desc,
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how the market share of a given nation within a given region has changed over two years  for a given part type.
The  market  share  for  a  given  nation  within  a  given  region  is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  the  revenue,  the  sum  of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'KENYA'
2. REGION is the value defined in Clause 4.2.3 for R_NAME where R_REGIONKEY corresponds to N_REGIONKEY for the selected NATION in item 1 above; In this case assume REGION 'AFRICA'
3. TYPE is randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume TYPE 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_year,
	sum(case
		when nation = 'KENYA' then volume
		else 0
	end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share
from
	(
		select
			extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,
			n2.n_name as nation
		from
			part,
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			orders,
			customer,
			nation n1,
			nation n2,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = l_partkey
			and s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and o_custkey = c_custkey
			and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
			and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'AFRICA'
			and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
			and o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
			and p_type = 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'
	) as all_nations
group by
	o_year
order by
	o_year;

QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'
