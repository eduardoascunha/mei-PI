Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query lists the revenue volume done through local suppliers.
The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions  in  which  the  customer  ordering  parts  and  the  supplier  filling  them  were  both  within  that  nation.  The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given  year. The  query displays  the  nations and revenue  volume  in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1  - l_discount)).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in C;aise 4.2.3; In this case assume REGION 'EUROPE'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume 1994-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	n_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	supplier,
	nation,
	region
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and l_suppkey = s_suppkey
	and c_nationkey = s_nationkey
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'EUROPE'
	and o_orderdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	n_name
order by
	revenue desc;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query retrieves the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value.
The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SEGMENT is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Segments in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume segment 'FURNITURE'
2. DATE is a randomly selected day within [1995-03-01 .. 1995-03-31]. In this case assume dates '1995-03-27', '1995-03-27'

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_orderkey,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE'
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate < date '1995-03-27'
	and l_shipdate > date '1995-03-27'
group by
	l_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
order by
	revenue desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 10;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This query identifies certain suppliers who were not able to ship required parts in a timely manner.
The Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a given nation, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order (with current status of 'F') where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date.
Return the first 100 selected rows
Substitution Parameters: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'ETHIOPIA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_name,

	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem l2
		where
			l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
			and l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
	)
	and not exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem l3
		where
			l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
			and l3.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
			and l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate
	)
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'ETHIOPIA'
group by
	s_name
order by
	numwait desc,
	s_name
limit 100;

QUESTION:
The Discounted Revenue Query reports the gross discounted revenue attributed to the sale of selected parts handled in  a  particular  manner. This  query  is  an  example  of  code  such  as  might be  produced  programmatically  by  a  data mining tool.
The  Discounted  Revenue  query  finds  the  gross  discounted  revenue  for  all  orders  for three  different  types  of  parts that  were  shipped by air  and  delivered in person. Parts are selected based on the  combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes.
Substitution Parameters:
1. QUANTITY1 is randomly selected within [1..10]. In this case assume QUANTITY1 = 4
2. QUANTITY2 is randomly selected within [10..20]. In this case assume QUANTITY2 = 16
3. QUANTITY3 is randomly selected within [20..30]. In this case assume QUANTITY3 = 29
4. BRAND1, BRAND2, BRAND3 = 'Brand#MN' where each MN is a two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]. In this case assume BRAND1 = 'Brand#11' , BRAND2 = 'Brand#25' , BRAND3 = 'Brand#54'

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice* (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	(
		p_partkey = l_partkey
		and p_brand = 'Brand#11'
		and p_container in ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
		and l_quantity >= 4 and l_quantity <= 4 + 10
		and p_size between 1 and 5
		and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
		and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
	)
	or
	(
		p_partkey = l_partkey
		and p_brand = 'Brand#25'
		and p_container in ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
		and l_quantity >= 16 and l_quantity <= 16 + 10
		and p_size between 1 and 10
		and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
		and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
	)
	or
	(
		p_partkey = l_partkey
		and p_brand = 'Brand#54'
		and p_container in ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
		and l_quantity >= 29 and l_quantity <= 29 + 10
		and p_size between 1 and 15
		and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
		and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
	);

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
The Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase.
This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years but  who  have  a  greater  than  average  “positive”  account  balance.  It  also  reflects  the magnitude  of  that  balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone. 
Substitution Parameters: 
1. I1 ... I7 are randomly selected without repetition from the possible values for Country code as defined in Clause 4.2.2.9. In this case assume ('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')

SQL QUERY:
select
	cntrycode,
	count(*) as numcust,
	sum(c_acctbal) as totacctbal
from
	(
		select
			substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) as cntrycode,
			c_acctbal
		from
			customer
		where
			substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in
				('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')
			and c_acctbal > (
				select
					avg(c_acctbal)
				from
					customer
				where
					c_acctbal > 0.00
					and substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in
						('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')
			)
			and not exists (
				select
					*
				from
					orders
				where
					o_custkey = c_custkey
			)
	) as custsale
group by
	cntrycode
order by
	cntrycode;

QUESTION:
This query determines the value of goods shipped between certain nations to help in the  re-negotiation of shipping 
contracts. 
The Volume  Shipping Query finds, for two given nations, the  gross discounted revenues derived from lineitems in which parts  were  shipped from a  supplier in either nation to a  customer in the  other nation during 1995 and 1996. The query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the revenue from shipments that took place  in that year. The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION1 'ARGENTINA'
2. NATION2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3 and must be different from the value selected for NATION1 in item 1 above. In this case assume NATION2 'KENYA'
