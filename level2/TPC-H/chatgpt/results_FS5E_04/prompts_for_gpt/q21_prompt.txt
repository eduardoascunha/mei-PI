Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_acctbal,
	s_name,
	n_name,
	p_partkey,
	p_mfgr,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	s_comment
from
	part,
	supplier,
	partsupp,
	nation,
	region
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
	and p_size = 2
	and p_type like '%TIN'
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'ASIA'
	and ps_supplycost = (
		select
			min(ps_supplycost)
		from
			partsupp,
			supplier,
			nation,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = ps_partkey
			and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'ASIA'
	)
order by
	s_acctbal desc,
	n_name,
	s_name,
	p_partkey
limit 100;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines the value of goods shipped between certain nations to help in the  re-negotiation of shipping 
contracts. 
The Volume  Shipping Query finds, for two given nations, the  gross discounted revenues derived from lineitems in which parts  were  shipped from a  supplier in either nation to a  customer in the  other nation during 1995 and 1996. The query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the revenue from shipments that took place  in that year. The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION1 'ARGENTINA'
2. NATION2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3 and must be different from the value selected for NATION1 in item 1 above. In this case assume NATION2 'KENYA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,
	l_year,
	sum(volume) as revenue
from
	(
		select
			n1.n_name as supp_nation,
			n2.n_name as cust_nation,
			extract(year from l_shipdate) as l_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume
		from
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			orders,
			customer,
			nation n1,
			nation n2
		where
			s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
			and c_custkey = o_custkey
			and s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
			and c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
			and (
				(n1.n_name = 'ARGENTINA' and n2.n_name = 'KENYA')
				or (n1.n_name = 'KENYA' and n2.n_name = 'ARGENTINA')
			)
			and l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
	) as shipping
group by
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,
	l_year
order by
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,
	l_year;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. 
This query determines  the  distribution of customers by  the  number of orders they have  made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern. 
Substitution Parameters:
1. WORD1 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: special, pending, unusual, express. In this case assume WORD1 unusual
2. WORD2 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: packages, requests, accounts, deposits. In this case assume WORD2 accounts

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_count,
	count(*) as custdist
from
	(
		select
			c_custkey,
			count(o_orderkey)
		from
			customer left outer join orders on
				c_custkey = o_custkey
				and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
		group by
			c_custkey
	) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by
	c_count
order by
	custdist desc,
	c_count desc;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
The query identifies customers who might be having problems with the parts that are shipped to them.
The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter,  who  have  returned  parts.  The  query  considers  only  parts  that  were  ordered  in  the  specified  quarter.  The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. DATE is the first day of a randomly selected month from the second month of 1993 to the first month of 1995. In this case assume DATE '1993-08-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	c_acctbal,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_phone,
	c_comment
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	nation
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate >= date '1993-08-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1993-08-01' + interval '3' month
	and l_returnflag = 'R'
	and c_nationkey = n_nationkey
group by
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	c_acctbal,
	c_phone,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_comment
order by
	revenue desc
limit 20;

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date.
The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in 
a given year, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for 
two  different  specified  ship  modes.  Only  lineitems  that  were  actually  shipped  before  the  l_commitdate  are  con-
sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a 
priority other than URGENT.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SHIPMODE1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume SHIPMODE1 'FOB'
2. SHIPMODE2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in  Clause  4.2.2.13 and must be different from the value selected for SHIPMODE1 in item 1; In this case assume SHIPMODE2 'MAIL'
3. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_shipmode,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT'
			or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as high_line_count,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT'
			and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as low_line_count
from
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey = l_orderkey
	and l_shipmode in ('FOB', 'MAIL')
	and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
	and l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'
	and l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	l_shipmode
order by
	l_shipmode;

QUESTION:
This query identifies certain suppliers who were not able to ship required parts in a timely manner.
The Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a given nation, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order (with current status of 'F') where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date.
Return the first 100 selected rows
Substitution Parameters: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'ETHIOPIA'
