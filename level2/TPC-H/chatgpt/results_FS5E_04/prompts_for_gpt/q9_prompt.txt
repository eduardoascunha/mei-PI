Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how the market share of a given nation within a given region has changed over two years  for a given part type.
The  market  share  for  a  given  nation  within  a  given  region  is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  the  revenue,  the  sum  of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'KENYA'
2. REGION is the value defined in Clause 4.2.3 for R_NAME where R_REGIONKEY corresponds to N_REGIONKEY for the selected NATION in item 1 above; In this case assume REGION 'AFRICA'
3. TYPE is randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume TYPE 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_year,
	sum(case
		when nation = 'KENYA' then volume
		else 0
	end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share
from
	(
		select
			extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,
			n2.n_name as nation
		from

			supplier,
			lineitem,
			orders,
			customer,
			nation n1,
			nation n2,
			region
		where

			and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and o_custkey = c_custkey
			and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
			and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'AFRICA'
			and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
			and o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
			and p_type = 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'
	) as all_nations
group by
	o_year
order by
	o_year;

QUESTION:
This query finds the most important subset of suppliers' stock in a given nation.
The Important Stock Identification Query finds, from scanning the available stock of suppliers in a given nation, all the parts that represent a significant 
percentage of the  total value of all available parts. The query displays the part number and the value of those parts in descending order of value.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'UNITED STATES'
2. FRACTION is chosen as 0.0001 / SF. In this case assume FRACTION 0.0001000000

SQL QUERY:
select
	ps_partkey,
	sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as value
from
	partsupp,
	supplier,
	nation
where
	ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'UNITED STATES'
group by

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  finds  out  how  many  suppliers  can  supply  parts  with  given  attributes.  It  might  be  used,  for  example,  to 
determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts. 
The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes as long as they are not of a given type, not of a given brand, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = Brand#MN where M and N are two single character strings representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#42'
2. TYPE is made of the  first 2 syllables of a string randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume TYPE 'LARGE PLATED%'
3. SIZE1 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE1 = 9
4. SIZE2 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE2 = 7
5. SIZE3 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE3 = 14
6. SIZE4 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE4 = 41
7. SIZE5 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE5 = 43
8. SIZE6 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE6 = 38
9. SIZE7 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE7 = 23
10. SIZE8 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]. In this case assume SIZE8 = 34

SQL QUERY:
select
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size,
	count(distinct ps_suppkey) as supplier_cnt
from
	partsupp,
	part
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and p_brand <> 'Brand#42'
	and p_type not like 'LARGE PLATED%'
	and p_size in (9, 7, 14, 41, 43, 38, 23, 34)
	and ps_suppkey not in (

order by
	supplier_cnt desc,
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
The query identifies customers who might be having problems with the parts that are shipped to them.
The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter,  who  have  returned  parts.  The  query  considers  only  parts  that  were  ordered  in  the  specified  quarter.  The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. DATE is the first day of a randomly selected month from the second month of 1993 to the first month of 1995. In this case assume DATE '1993-08-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	c_acctbal,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_phone,

	and l_returnflag = 'R'
	and c_nationkey = n_nationkey
group by
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	c_acctbal,

	c_address,
	c_comment
order by
	revenue desc
limit 20;

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
This query retrieves the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value.
The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SEGMENT is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Segments in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume segment 'FURNITURE'
2. DATE is a randomly selected day within [1995-03-01 .. 1995-03-31]. In this case assume dates '1995-03-27', '1995-03-27'

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_orderkey,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
from
	customer,

QUESTION:
This query determines how much profit is made on a given line of parts, broken out by supplier nation and year.
The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the  sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount))  -  (ps_supplycost  * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the  year 
and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume COLOR '%red%'
