Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  determines  how  much  average  yearly  revenue  would  be  lost  if  orders  were  no longer  filled  for  small quantities of certain parts. This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments.
The  Small-Quantity-Order  Revenue  Query  considers  parts  of  a  given  brand  and  with  a given  container  type  and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7 -year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = 'Brand#MN' where MN is a  two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#23'
2. CONTAINER  is  randomly  selected  within  the  list  of  2-syllable  strings  defined  for Containers  in  Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume CONTAINER 'SM CAN'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given container type", columns [part.p_container] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice, lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity of", columns [lineitem.l_partkey] may be used.
According to "parts with", columns [part.p_brand, part.p_partkey] may be used.
Values [0.2, 7.0, Brand#23, SM CAN] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_yearly
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	p_partkey = l_partkey
	and p_brand = 'Brand#23'
	and p_container = 'SM CAN'
	and l_quantity < (
		select
			0.2 * avg(l_quantity)
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_partkey = p_partkey
	);

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  quantifies  the  amount  of  revenue  increase  that  would  have  resulted  from  eliminating  certain  company-wide discounts in a given percentage range in a given year. Asking this type of "what if" query can be used to look for ways to increase revenues.
The Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped in a given year with discounts between DISCOUNT-0.01  and  DISCOUNT+0.01.  The  query  lists  the  amount  by  which  the  total  revenue  would  have increased  if  these  discounts  had  been  eliminated  for  lineitems  with  l_quantity  less  than  quantity.  Note  that  the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]; In this case assume DATE '1994-01-01'
2. DISCOUNT is randomly selected within [0.02 .. 0.09]; In this case assume DISCOUNT 0.02
3. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [24 .. 25]. In this case assume QUANTITY 25

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "l_discount for all lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "lineitems shipped in", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "lineitems with l_quantity", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "of l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
Values [0.01, 0.02, 1, 1994-01-01, 25] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) as revenue
from
	lineitem
where
	l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
	and l_discount between 0.02 - 0.01 and 0.02 + 0.01
	and l_quantity < 25;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
The Potential Part Promotion Query identifies suppliers in a particular nation having selected parts that may be candidates for a promotional offer.
The  Potential Part Promotion  query identifies suppliers  who have an excess of a  given part available; an excess is defined  to  be  more  than  50%  of  the  parts  like  the  given  part  that  the  supplier shipped  in  a  given  year  for  a  given nation. Only parts whose names share a certain naming convention are considered.
Substitution Parameters:
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME. In this case assume COLOR 'brown%'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within 1993..1997. In this case assume DATE '1994-01-01'
3. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'SAUDI ARABIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given nation", columns [nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "given part available", columns [partsupp.ps_availqty] may be used.
According to "identifies suppliers in a", columns [supplier.s_name] may be used.
According to "nation only", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "p_name in this case", columns [part.p_name] may be used.
According to "part promotion query identifies", columns [partsupp.ps_partkey, partsupp.ps_suppkey] may be used.
According to "parts whose names", columns [part.p_partkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers in a particular", columns [supplier.s_address, supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
Values [0.5, 1, 1994-01-01, SAUDI ARABIA, brown%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_name,
	s_address
from
	supplier,
	nation
where
	s_suppkey in (
		select
			ps_suppkey
		from
			partsupp
		where
			ps_partkey in (
				select
					p_partkey
				from
					part
				where
					p_name like 'brown%'
			)
			and ps_availqty > (
				select
					0.5 * sum(l_quantity)
				from
					lineitem
				where
					l_partkey = ps_partkey
					and l_suppkey = ps_suppkey
					and l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
					and l_shipdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
			)
	)
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
order by
	s_name;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This query reports the amount of business that was billed, shipped, and returned. 
The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped as of a given date. The  date  is  within  60  -  120  days  of  the  greatest  ship  date  contained  in  the  database.  The  query  lists  totals  for extended  price,  discounted  extended  price,  discounted  extended  price  plus  tax,  average  quantity,  average  extended price,  and  average  discount.  These  aggregates  are  grouped  by  RETURNFLAG  and  LINESTATUS,  and  listed  in  ascending  order  of  RETURNFLAG  and  LINESTATUS.  A  count  of  the  number  of  lineitems  in  each  group  is included. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:  
1. DELTA is randomly selected within [60. 120]. In this case assume DELTA = '84 days'
Comment: 1998-12-01 is the highest possible ship date as defined in the database population. (This is ENDDATE - 30).  The  query  will  include  all  lineitems  shipped  before  this  date  minus  DELTA  days.  The  intent  is  to  choose DELTA so that between 95% and 97% of the rows in the table are scanned.

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "lineitems in", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "lineitems shipped before", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "linestatus and", columns [lineitem.l_linestatus] may be used.
According to "number of lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "of lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_tax] may be used.
According to "price discounted extended price", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "returnflag and linestatus a", columns [lineitem.l_returnflag] may be used.
Values [1998-12-01, 84 days] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_returnflag,
	l_linestatus,
	sum(l_quantity) as sum_qty,
	sum(l_extendedprice) as sum_base_price,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as sum_disc_price,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) * (1 + l_tax)) as sum_charge,
	avg(l_quantity) as avg_qty,
	avg(l_extendedprice) as avg_price,
	avg(l_discount) as avg_disc,
	count(*) as count_order
from
	lineitem
where
	l_shipdate <= date '1998-12-01' - interval '84 days'
group by
	l_returnflag,
	l_linestatus
order by
	l_returnflag,
	l_linestatus;

The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [312..315]. In this case assume QUANTITY = 314

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "customer key the", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "customer name customer", columns [customer.c_name] may be used.
According to "key the order key", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.

QUESTION:
The Discounted Revenue Query reports the gross discounted revenue attributed to the sale of selected parts handled in  a  particular  manner. This  query  is  an  example  of  code  such  as  might be  produced  programmatically  by  a  data mining tool.
The  Discounted  Revenue  query  finds  the  gross  discounted  revenue  for  all  orders  for three  different  types  of  parts that  were  shipped by air  and  delivered in person. Parts are selected based on the  combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes.
Substitution Parameters:
1. QUANTITY1 is randomly selected within [1..10]. In this case assume QUANTITY1 = 4
2. QUANTITY2 is randomly selected within [10..20]. In this case assume QUANTITY2 = 16
3. QUANTITY3 is randomly selected within [20..30]. In this case assume QUANTITY3 = 29
4. BRAND1, BRAND2, BRAND3 = 'Brand#MN' where each MN is a two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]. In this case assume BRAND1 = 'Brand#11' , BRAND2 = 'Brand#25' , BRAND3 = 'Brand#54'

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
