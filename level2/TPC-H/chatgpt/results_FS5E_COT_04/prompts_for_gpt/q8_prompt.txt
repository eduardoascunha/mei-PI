Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how much profit is made on a given line of parts, broken out by supplier nation and year.
The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the  sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount))  -  (ps_supplycost  * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the  year 
and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume COLOR '%red%'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "for all lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_suppkey] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "l_quantity for all lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "lineitems describing parts in", columns [lineitem.l_partkey] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "of l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "order and", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "ordered in that year", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "p_name in", columns [part.p_name] may be used.
According to "parts in the specified", columns [part.p_partkey, partsupp.ps_partkey] may be used.
According to "ps_supplycost l_quantity", columns [partsupp.ps_suppkey, partsupp.ps_supplycost] may be used.
According to "supplier in", columns [supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier nation and", columns [supplier.s_nationkey] may be used.
Values [%red%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	nation,
	o_year,
	sum(amount) as sum_profit
from
	(
		select
			n_name as nation,
			extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity as amount
		from
			part,
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			partsupp,
			orders,
			nation
		where
			s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and ps_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and ps_partkey = l_partkey
			and p_partkey = l_partkey
			and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and p_name like '%red%'
	) as profit
group by
	nation,
	o_year
order by
	nation,
	o_year desc;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query lists the revenue volume done through local suppliers.
The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions  in  which  the  customer  ordering  parts  and  the  supplier  filling  them  were  both  within  that  nation.  The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given  year. The  query displays  the  nations and revenue  volume  in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1  - l_discount)).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in C;aise 4.2.3; In this case assume REGION 'EUROPE'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume 1994-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "l_extendedprice 1", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "lineitems in", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_suppkey] may be used.
According to "nation in a region", columns [nation.n_regionkey] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "order to", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderdate, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "particular nation is defined", columns [customer.c_nationkey] may be used.
According to "region is", columns [region.r_name] may be used.
According to "region the", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers the", columns [supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers the local supplier", columns [supplier.s_nationkey] may be used.
Values [1, 1994-01-01, EUROPE] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	n_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	supplier,
	nation,
	region
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and l_suppkey = s_suppkey
	and c_nationkey = s_nationkey
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'EUROPE'
	and o_orderdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	n_name
order by
	revenue desc;

QUESTION:
The Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase.
This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years but  who  have  a  greater  than  average  “positive”  account  balance.  It  also  reflects  the magnitude  of  that  balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone. 
Substitution Parameters: 
1. I1 ... I7 are randomly selected without repetition from the possible values for Country code as defined in Clause 4.2.2.9. In this case assume ('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "c_phone substitution", columns [customer.c_phone] may be used.
According to "customers who", columns [customer.c_acctbal] may be used.
According to "orders for", columns [orders.o_custkey] may be used.
According to "two characters of c_phone", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
Values [0.00, 10, 2, 21, 26, 28, 30, 31, 33] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	cntrycode,
	count(*) as numcust,
	sum(c_acctbal) as totacctbal
from
	(
		select
			substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) as cntrycode,
			c_acctbal
		from
			customer
		where
			substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in
				('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')
			and c_acctbal > (
				select
					avg(c_acctbal)
				from
					customer
				where
					c_acctbal > 0.00
					and substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in
						('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')
			)
			and not exists (
				select
					*
				from
					orders
				where
					o_custkey = c_custkey
			)
	) as custsale
group by
	cntrycode
order by
	cntrycode;

QUESTION:
This query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date.
The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in 
a given year, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for 
two  different  specified  ship  modes.  Only  lineitems  that  were  actually  shipped  before  the  l_commitdate  are  con-
sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a 
priority other than URGENT.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SHIPMODE1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume SHIPMODE1 'FOB'
2. SHIPMODE2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in  Clause  4.2.2.13 and must be different from the value selected for SHIPMODE1 in item 1; In this case assume SHIPMODE2 'MAIL'
3. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "belonging to orders for", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "for lineitems actually received", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "l_commitdate for", columns [lineitem.l_commitdate] may be used.
According to "l_receiptdate exceeds the", columns [lineitem.l_receiptdate] may be used.
According to "lineitems belonging to orders", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order priority query", columns [orders.o_orderpriority] may be used.
According to "ship mode for lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_shipmode] may be used.
Values [1, 1-URGENT, 1996-01-01, 2-HIGH, FOB, MAIL] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_shipmode,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT'
			or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as high_line_count,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT'
			and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as low_line_count
from
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey = l_orderkey
	and l_shipmode in ('FOB', 'MAIL')
	and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
	and l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'
	and l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	l_shipmode
order by
	l_shipmode;

QUESTION:
This query determines how the market share of a given nation within a given region has changed over two years  for a given part type.
The  market  share  for  a  given  nation  within  a  given  region  is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  the  revenue,  the  sum  of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'KENYA'
2. REGION is the value defined in Clause 4.2.3 for R_NAME where R_REGIONKEY corresponds to N_REGIONKEY for the selected NATION in item 1 above; In this case assume REGION 'AFRICA'
3. TYPE is randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume TYPE 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'
