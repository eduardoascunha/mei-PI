Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "cost supplier query finds", columns [partsupp.ps_supplycost] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "part in", columns [part.p_partkey, partsupp.ps_partkey] may be used.
According to "part s number", columns [part.p_mfgr, partsupp.ps_suppkey] may be used.
According to "part type", columns [part.p_type] may be used.
According to "part type and size", columns [part.p_size] may be used.
According to "region for", columns [nation.n_regionkey, region.r_name] may be used.
According to "region the", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "supplier s", columns [supplier.s_acctbal, supplier.s_comment, supplier.s_name, supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier s address", columns [supplier.s_address] may be used.
According to "supplier s address phone", columns [supplier.s_phone] may be used.
Values [%TIN, 2, ASIA] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_acctbal,
	s_name,
	n_name,
	p_partkey,
	p_mfgr,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	s_comment
from
	part,
	supplier,
	partsupp,
	nation,
	region
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
	and p_size = 2
	and p_type like '%TIN'
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'ASIA'
	and ps_supplycost = (
		select
			min(ps_supplycost)
		from
			partsupp,
			supplier,
			nation,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = ps_partkey
			and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'ASIA'
	)
order by
	s_acctbal desc,
	n_name,
	s_name,
	p_partkey
limit 100;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  determines  how  much  average  yearly  revenue  would  be  lost  if  orders  were  no longer  filled  for  small quantities of certain parts. This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments.
The  Small-Quantity-Order  Revenue  Query  considers  parts  of  a  given  brand  and  with  a given  container  type  and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7 -year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = 'Brand#MN' where MN is a  two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#23'
2. CONTAINER  is  randomly  selected  within  the  list  of  2-syllable  strings  defined  for Containers  in  Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume CONTAINER 'SM CAN'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given container type", columns [part.p_container] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice, lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity of", columns [lineitem.l_partkey] may be used.
According to "parts with", columns [part.p_brand, part.p_partkey] may be used.
Values [0.2, 7.0, Brand#23, SM CAN] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_yearly
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	p_partkey = l_partkey
	and p_brand = 'Brand#23'
	and p_container = 'SM CAN'
	and l_quantity < (
		select
			0.2 * avg(l_quantity)
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_partkey = p_partkey
	);

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
The  Large  Volume  Customer  Query  ranks  customers  based  on  their  having  placed  a  large  quantity  order.  Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level.
The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [312..315]. In this case assume QUANTITY = 314

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "customer key the", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "customer name customer", columns [customer.c_name] may be used.
According to "key the order key", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order key", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order key date", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "orders whose total", columns [orders.o_totalprice] may be used.
According to "text 1 quantity is", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
Values [314] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice,
	sum(l_quantity)
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey in (
		select
			l_orderkey
		from
			lineitem
		group by
			l_orderkey having
				sum(l_quantity) > 314
	)
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
group by
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice
order by
	o_totalprice desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 100;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This query monitors the market response to a promotion such as TV advertisements or a special campaign.
The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)). 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first day of a month randomly selected from a random year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-04-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "as l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "parts the", columns [part.p_partkey, part.p_type] may be used.
According to "shipped in that month", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
Values [1, 100.00, 1996-04-01, PROMO%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	100.00 * sum(case
		when p_type like 'PROMO%'
			then l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
		else 0
	end) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	l_partkey = p_partkey
	and l_shipdate >= date '1996-04-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1996-04-01' + interval '1' month;

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date.
The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in 
a given year, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for 
two  different  specified  ship  modes.  Only  lineitems  that  were  actually  shipped  before  the  l_commitdate  are  con-
sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a 
priority other than URGENT.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SHIPMODE1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume SHIPMODE1 'FOB'
2. SHIPMODE2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in  Clause  4.2.2.13 and must be different from the value selected for SHIPMODE1 in item 1; In this case assume SHIPMODE2 'MAIL'
3. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "belonging to orders for", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "for lineitems actually received", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "l_commitdate for", columns [lineitem.l_commitdate] may be used.
According to "l_receiptdate exceeds the", columns [lineitem.l_receiptdate] may be used.
According to "lineitems belonging to orders", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order priority query", columns [orders.o_orderpriority] may be used.
According to "ship mode for lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_shipmode] may be used.
Values [1, 1-URGENT, 1996-01-01, 2-HIGH, FOB, MAIL] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_shipmode,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT'
			or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as high_line_count,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT'
			and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as low_line_count
from
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey = l_orderkey
	and l_shipmode in ('FOB', 'MAIL')
	and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
	and l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'
	and l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	l_shipmode
order by
	l_shipmode;

QUESTION:
The Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase.
This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years but  who  have  a  greater  than  average  “positive”  account  balance.  It  also  reflects  the magnitude  of  that  balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone. 
Substitution Parameters: 
1. I1 ... I7 are randomly selected without repetition from the possible values for Country code as defined in Clause 4.2.2.9. In this case assume ('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
