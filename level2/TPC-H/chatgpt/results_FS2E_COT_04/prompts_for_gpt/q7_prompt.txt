Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query lists the revenue volume done through local suppliers.
The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions  in  which  the  customer  ordering  parts  and  the  supplier  filling  them  were  both  within  that  nation.  The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given  year. The  query displays  the  nations and revenue  volume  in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1  - l_discount)).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in C;aise 4.2.3; In this case assume REGION 'EUROPE'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume 1994-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "l_extendedprice 1", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "lineitems in", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_suppkey] may be used.
According to "nation in a region", columns [nation.n_regionkey] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "order to", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderdate, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "particular nation is defined", columns [customer.c_nationkey] may be used.
According to "region is", columns [region.r_name] may be used.
According to "region the", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers the", columns [supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers the local supplier", columns [supplier.s_nationkey] may be used.
Values [1, 1994-01-01, EUROPE] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	n_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	supplier,
	nation,
	region
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and l_suppkey = s_suppkey
	and c_nationkey = s_nationkey
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'EUROPE'
	and o_orderdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	n_name
order by
	revenue desc;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query identifies certain suppliers who were not able to ship required parts in a timely manner.
The Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a given nation, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order (with current status of 'F') where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date.
Return the first 100 selected rows
Substitution Parameters: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'ETHIOPIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "1 nation", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "date return", columns [lineitem.l_receiptdate] may be used.
According to "given nation", columns [nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "identifies suppliers for a", columns [supplier.s_name] may be used.
According to "order with", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order with current status", columns [orders.o_orderstatus] may be used.
According to "supplier who", columns [supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
Values [ETHIOPIA, F] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_name,
	count(*) as numwait
from
	supplier,
	lineitem l1,
	orders,
	nation
where
	s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
	and o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
	and o_orderstatus = 'F'
	and l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem l2
		where
			l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
			and l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
	)
	and not exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem l3
		where
			l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
			and l3.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
			and l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate
	)
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'ETHIOPIA'
group by
	s_name
order by
	numwait desc,
	s_name
limit 100;

QUESTION:
This query determines the value of goods shipped between certain nations to help in the  re-negotiation of shipping 
contracts. 
The Volume  Shipping Query finds, for two given nations, the  gross discounted revenues derived from lineitems in which parts  were  shipped from a  supplier in either nation to a  customer in the  other nation during 1995 and 1996. The query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the revenue from shipments that took place  in that year. The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION1 'ARGENTINA'
2. NATION2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3 and must be different from the value selected for NATION1 in item 1 above. In this case assume NATION2 'KENYA'

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
