Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  determines  how  much  average  yearly  revenue  would  be  lost  if  orders  were  no longer  filled  for  small quantities of certain parts. This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments.
The  Small-Quantity-Order  Revenue  Query  considers  parts  of  a  given  brand  and  with  a given  container  type  and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7 -year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = 'Brand#MN' where MN is a  two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#23'
2. CONTAINER  is  randomly  selected  within  the  list  of  2-syllable  strings  defined  for Containers  in  Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume CONTAINER 'SM CAN'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given container type", columns [part.p_container] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice, lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity of", columns [lineitem.l_partkey] may be used.
According to "parts with", columns [part.p_brand, part.p_partkey] may be used.
Values [0.2, 7.0, Brand#23, SM CAN] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_yearly
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	p_partkey = l_partkey
	and p_brand = 'Brand#23'
	and p_container = 'SM CAN'
	and l_quantity < (
		select
			0.2 * avg(l_quantity)
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_partkey = p_partkey
	);

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
The Potential Part Promotion Query identifies suppliers in a particular nation having selected parts that may be candidates for a promotional offer.
The  Potential Part Promotion  query identifies suppliers  who have an excess of a  given part available; an excess is defined  to  be  more  than  50%  of  the  parts  like  the  given  part  that  the  supplier shipped  in  a  given  year  for  a  given nation. Only parts whose names share a certain naming convention are considered.
Substitution Parameters:
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME. In this case assume COLOR 'brown%'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within 1993..1997. In this case assume DATE '1994-01-01'
3. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'SAUDI ARABIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given nation", columns [nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "given part available", columns [partsupp.ps_availqty] may be used.
According to "identifies suppliers in a", columns [supplier.s_name] may be used.
According to "nation only", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "p_name in this case", columns [part.p_name] may be used.
According to "part promotion query identifies", columns [partsupp.ps_partkey, partsupp.ps_suppkey] may be used.
According to "parts whose names", columns [part.p_partkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers in a particular", columns [supplier.s_address, supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
Values [0.5, 1, 1994-01-01, SAUDI ARABIA, brown%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_name,
	s_address
from
	supplier,
	nation
where
	s_suppkey in (
		select
			ps_suppkey
		from
			partsupp
		where
			ps_partkey in (
				select
					p_partkey
				from
					part
				where
					p_name like 'brown%'
			)
			and ps_availqty > (
				select
					0.5 * sum(l_quantity)
				from
					lineitem
				where
					l_partkey = ps_partkey
					and l_suppkey = ps_suppkey
					and l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
					and l_shipdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
			)
	)
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
order by
	s_name;

QUESTION:
The Discounted Revenue Query reports the gross discounted revenue attributed to the sale of selected parts handled in  a  particular  manner. This  query  is  an  example  of  code  such  as  might be  produced  programmatically  by  a  data mining tool.
The  Discounted  Revenue  query  finds  the  gross  discounted  revenue  for  all  orders  for three  different  types  of  parts that  were  shipped by air  and  delivered in person. Parts are selected based on the  combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes.
Substitution Parameters:
1. QUANTITY1 is randomly selected within [1..10]. In this case assume QUANTITY1 = 4
2. QUANTITY2 is randomly selected within [10..20]. In this case assume QUANTITY2 = 16
3. QUANTITY3 is randomly selected within [20..30]. In this case assume QUANTITY3 = 29
4. BRAND1, BRAND2, BRAND3 = 'Brand#MN' where each MN is a two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]. In this case assume BRAND1 = 'Brand#11' , BRAND2 = 'Brand#25' , BRAND3 = 'Brand#54'

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
