Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. 
This query determines  the  distribution of customers by  the  number of orders they have  made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern. 
Substitution Parameters:
1. WORD1 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: special, pending, unusual, express. In this case assume WORD1 unusual
2. WORD2 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: packages, requests, accounts, deposits. In this case assume WORD2 accounts

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "customers who", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "order comment", columns [orders.o_comment] may be used.
According to "orders how", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "orders special", columns [orders.o_custkey] may be used.
Values [%unusual%accounts%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_count,
	count(*) as custdist
from
	(
		select
			c_custkey,
			count(o_orderkey)
		from
			customer left outer join orders on
				c_custkey = o_custkey
				and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
		group by
			c_custkey
	) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by
	c_count
order by
	custdist desc,
	c_count desc;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query lists the revenue volume done through local suppliers.
The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions  in  which  the  customer  ordering  parts  and  the  supplier  filling  them  were  both  within  that  nation.  The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given  year. The  query displays  the  nations and revenue  volume  in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1  - l_discount)).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in C;aise 4.2.3; In this case assume REGION 'EUROPE'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume 1994-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "l_extendedprice 1", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "lineitems in", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_suppkey] may be used.
According to "nation in a region", columns [nation.n_regionkey] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "order to", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderdate, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "particular nation is defined", columns [customer.c_nationkey] may be used.
According to "region is", columns [region.r_name] may be used.
According to "region the", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers the", columns [supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers the local supplier", columns [supplier.s_nationkey] may be used.
Values [1, 1994-01-01, EUROPE] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	n_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	supplier,
	nation,
	region
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and l_suppkey = s_suppkey
	and c_nationkey = s_nationkey
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'EUROPE'
	and o_orderdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	n_name
order by
	revenue desc;

QUESTION:
The  Large  Volume  Customer  Query  ranks  customers  based  on  their  having  placed  a  large  quantity  order.  Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level.
The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [312..315]. In this case assume QUANTITY = 314

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
