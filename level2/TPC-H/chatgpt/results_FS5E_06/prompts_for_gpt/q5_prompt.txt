Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines the value of goods shipped between certain nations to help in the  re-negotiation of shipping 
contracts. 
The Volume  Shipping Query finds, for two given nations, the  gross discounted revenues derived from lineitems in which parts  were  shipped from a  supplier in either nation to a  customer in the  other nation during 1995 and 1996. The query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the revenue from shipments that took place  in that year. The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION1 'ARGENTINA'
2. NATION2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3 and must be different from the value selected for NATION1 in item 1 above. In this case assume NATION2 'KENYA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,
	l_year,
	sum(volume) as revenue
from
	(
		select
			n1.n_name as supp_nation,
			n2.n_name as cust_nation,
			extract(year from l_shipdate) as l_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume
		from
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			orders,
			customer,
			nation n1,
			nation n2
		where
			s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
			and c_custkey = o_custkey
			and s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
			and c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
			and (
				(n1.n_name = 'ARGENTINA' and n2.n_name = 'KENYA')
				or (n1.n_name = 'KENYA' and n2.n_name = 'ARGENTINA')
			)
			and l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'

order by
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,

QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

SQL QUERY:

QUESTION:
This query determines how the market share of a given nation within a given region has changed over two years  for a given part type.
The  market  share  for  a  given  nation  within  a  given  region  is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  the  revenue,  the  sum  of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'KENYA'
2. REGION is the value defined in Clause 4.2.3 for R_NAME where R_REGIONKEY corresponds to N_REGIONKEY for the selected NATION in item 1 above; In this case assume REGION 'AFRICA'
3. TYPE is randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume TYPE 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_year,
	sum(case
		when nation = 'KENYA' then volume
		else 0
	end) / sum(volume) as mkt_share
from
	(
		select
			extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume,
			n2.n_name as nation

			supplier,
			lineitem,
			orders,
			customer,

			nation n2,
			region

			p_partkey = l_partkey
			and s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and o_custkey = c_custkey
			and c_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
			and n1.n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'AFRICA'
			and s_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
			and o_orderdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
			and p_type = 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'
	) as all_nations

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  quantifies  the  amount  of  revenue  increase  that  would  have  resulted  from  eliminating  certain  company-wide discounts in a given percentage range in a given year. Asking this type of "what if" query can be used to look for ways to increase revenues.
The Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped in a given year with discounts between DISCOUNT-0.01  and  DISCOUNT+0.01.  The  query  lists  the  amount  by  which  the  total  revenue  would  have increased  if  these  discounts  had  been  eliminated  for  lineitems  with  l_quantity  less  than  quantity.  Note  that  the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]; In this case assume DATE '1994-01-01'
2. DISCOUNT is randomly selected within [0.02 .. 0.09]; In this case assume DISCOUNT 0.02
3. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [24 .. 25]. In this case assume QUANTITY 25

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) as revenue
from
	lineitem
where
	l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
	and l_discount between 0.02 - 0.01 and 0.02 + 0.01
	and l_quantity < 25;

QUESTION:
The  Large  Volume  Customer  Query  ranks  customers  based  on  their  having  placed  a  large  quantity  order.  Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level.
The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [312..315]. In this case assume QUANTITY = 314

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice,
	sum(l_quantity)
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey in (
		select
			l_orderkey
		from
			lineitem
		group by
			l_orderkey having
				sum(l_quantity) > 314
	)
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
group by
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice
order by
	o_totalprice desc,

QUESTION:
This query lists the revenue volume done through local suppliers.
The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions  in  which  the  customer  ordering  parts  and  the  supplier  filling  them  were  both  within  that  nation.  The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given  year. The  query displays  the  nations and revenue  volume  in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1  - l_discount)).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in C;aise 4.2.3; In this case assume REGION 'EUROPE'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume 1994-01-01'
