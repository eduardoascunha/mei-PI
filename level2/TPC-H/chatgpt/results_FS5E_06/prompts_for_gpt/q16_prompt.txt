--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_acctbal,
	s_name,
	n_name,
	p_partkey,
	p_mfgr,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	s_comment
from
	part,
	supplier,
	partsupp,
	nation,
	region
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
	and p_size = 2
	and p_type like '%TIN'
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'ASIA'
	and ps_supplycost = (

			and r_name = 'ASIA'
	)
order by
	s_acctbal desc,
	n_name,
	s_name,
	p_partkey
limit 100;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. 
This query determines  the  distribution of customers by  the  number of orders they have  made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern. 
Substitution Parameters:
1. WORD1 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: special, pending, unusual, express. In this case assume WORD1 unusual
2. WORD2 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: packages, requests, accounts, deposits. In this case assume WORD2 accounts

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_count,
	count(*) as custdist
from
	(
		select
			c_custkey,
			count(o_orderkey)
		from
			customer left outer join orders on
				c_custkey = o_custkey
				and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
		group by
			c_custkey
	) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by
	c_count
order by
	custdist desc,
	c_count desc;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This query identifies certain suppliers who were not able to ship required parts in a timely manner.
The Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a given nation, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order (with current status of 'F') where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date.
Return the first 100 selected rows
Substitution Parameters: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'ETHIOPIA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_name,
	count(*) as numwait

	lineitem l1,
	orders,
	nation

	s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
	and o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
	and o_orderstatus = 'F'
	and l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem l2
		where
			l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
			and l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
	)
	and not exists (

	)
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'ETHIOPIA'
group by
	s_name
order by
	numwait desc,
	s_name
limit 100;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how much profit is made on a given line of parts, broken out by supplier nation and year.
The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the  sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount))  -  (ps_supplycost  * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the  year 
and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume COLOR '%red%'

SQL QUERY:
select
	nation,
	o_year,
	sum(amount) as sum_profit
from
	(
		select
			n_name as nation,
			extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity as amount
		from
			part,
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			partsupp,
			orders,
			nation
		where
			s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and ps_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and ps_partkey = l_partkey
			and p_partkey = l_partkey
			and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and p_name like '%red%'
	) as profit
group by
	nation,
	o_year
order by
	nation,
	o_year desc;

QUESTION:
The Discounted Revenue Query reports the gross discounted revenue attributed to the sale of selected parts handled in  a  particular  manner. This  query  is  an  example  of  code  such  as  might be  produced  programmatically  by  a  data mining tool.
The  Discounted  Revenue  query  finds  the  gross  discounted  revenue  for  all  orders  for three  different  types  of  parts that  were  shipped by air  and  delivered in person. Parts are selected based on the  combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes.
Substitution Parameters:
1. QUANTITY1 is randomly selected within [1..10]. In this case assume QUANTITY1 = 4
2. QUANTITY2 is randomly selected within [10..20]. In this case assume QUANTITY2 = 16
3. QUANTITY3 is randomly selected within [20..30]. In this case assume QUANTITY3 = 29
4. BRAND1, BRAND2, BRAND3 = 'Brand#MN' where each MN is a two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]. In this case assume BRAND1 = 'Brand#11' , BRAND2 = 'Brand#25' , BRAND3 = 'Brand#54'

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice* (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	(

	)
	or
	(
		p_partkey = l_partkey
		and p_brand = 'Brand#25'
		and p_container in ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
		and l_quantity >= 16 and l_quantity <= 16 + 10
		and p_size between 1 and 10

--- Your Task ---
QUESTION:
This  query  finds  out  how  many  suppliers  can  supply  parts  with  given  attributes.  It  might  be  used,  for  example,  to 
determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts. 
The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes as long as they are not of a given type, not of a given brand, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = Brand#MN where M and N are two single character strings representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#42'
2. TYPE is made of the  first 2 syllables of a string randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume TYPE 'LARGE PLATED%'
3. SIZE1 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE1 = 9
4. SIZE2 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE2 = 7
5. SIZE3 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE3 = 14
6. SIZE4 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE4 = 41
7. SIZE5 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE5 = 43
8. SIZE6 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE6 = 38
9. SIZE7 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE7 = 23
10. SIZE8 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]. In this case assume SIZE8 = 34
