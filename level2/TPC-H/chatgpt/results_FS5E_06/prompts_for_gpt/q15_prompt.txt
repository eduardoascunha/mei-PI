Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_acctbal,
	s_name,
	n_name,
	p_partkey,
	p_mfgr,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	s_comment
from
	part,
	supplier,
	partsupp,
	nation,
	region
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
	and p_size = 2
	and p_type like '%TIN'
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'ASIA'
	and ps_supplycost = (
		select
			min(ps_supplycost)
		from
			partsupp,
			supplier,
			nation,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = ps_partkey
			and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'ASIA'
	)
order by
	s_acctbal desc,
	n_name,
	s_name,
	p_partkey
limit 100;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how well the order priority system is working and gives an assessment of customer satisfaction.
The Order Priority Checking Query counts the number of orders ordered in a given quarter of a given year in which at least one lineitem  was received by the  customer later than its committed date. The  query lists the  count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the  10th  month  of 1997. In this case assume date '1997-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_orderpriority,
	count(*) as order_count
from
	orders
where
	o_orderdate >= date '1997-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	)
group by
	o_orderpriority
order by
	o_orderpriority;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This query retrieves the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value.
The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SEGMENT is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Segments in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume segment 'FURNITURE'
2. DATE is a randomly selected day within [1995-03-01 .. 1995-03-31]. In this case assume dates '1995-03-27', '1995-03-27'

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_orderkey,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE'
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate < date '1995-03-27'
	and l_shipdate > date '1995-03-27'
group by
	l_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
order by
	revenue desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 10;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This query monitors the market response to a promotion such as TV advertisements or a special campaign.
The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)). 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first day of a month randomly selected from a random year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-04-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	100.00 * sum(case
		when p_type like 'PROMO%'
			then l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
		else 0
	end) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	l_partkey = p_partkey
	and l_shipdate >= date '1996-04-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1996-04-01' + interval '1' month;

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
The  Large  Volume  Customer  Query  ranks  customers  based  on  their  having  placed  a  large  quantity  order.  Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level.
The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [312..315]. In this case assume QUANTITY = 314

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice,
	sum(l_quantity)
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey in (
		select
			l_orderkey
		from
			lineitem
		group by
			l_orderkey having
				sum(l_quantity) > 314
	)
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
group by
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice
order by
	o_totalprice desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 100;

QUESTION:
This query determines the top supplier so it can be rewarded, given more business, or identified for special recognition.
The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during a  given  quarter  of  a  given  year.  In  case  of  a  tie,  the  query lists  all  suppliers  whose  contribution  was  equal  to  the maximum, presented in supplier number order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the 10th  month of 1997. In this case assume DATE '1997-01-01'
