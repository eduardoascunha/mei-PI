Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. 
This query determines  the  distribution of customers by  the  number of orders they have  made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern. 
Substitution Parameters:
1. WORD1 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: special, pending, unusual, express. In this case assume WORD1 unusual
2. WORD2 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: packages, requests, accounts, deposits. In this case assume WORD2 accounts

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_count,
	count(*) as custdist
from
	(
		select
			c_custkey,
			count(o_orderkey)
		from
			customer left outer join orders on
				c_custkey = o_custkey
				and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
		group by
			c_custkey
	) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by
	c_count
order by
	custdist desc,
	c_count desc;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  finds  out  how  many  suppliers  can  supply  parts  with  given  attributes.  It  might  be  used,  for  example,  to 
determine whether there is a sufficient number of suppliers for heavily ordered parts. 
The Parts/Supplier Relationship Query counts the number of suppliers who can supply parts that satisfy a particular customer's requirements. The customer is interested in parts of eight different sizes as long as they are not of a given type, not of a given brand, and not from a supplier who has had complaints registered at the Better Business Bureau. Results must be presented in descending count and ascending brand, type, and size.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = Brand#MN where M and N are two single character strings representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#42'
2. TYPE is made of the  first 2 syllables of a string randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume TYPE 'LARGE PLATED%'
3. SIZE1 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE1 = 9
4. SIZE2 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE2 = 7
5. SIZE3 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE3 = 14
6. SIZE4 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE4 = 41
7. SIZE5 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE5 = 43
8. SIZE6 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE6 = 38
9. SIZE7 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]; In this case assume SIZE7 = 23
10. SIZE8 is randomly selected as a set of eight different values within [1 .. 50]. In this case assume SIZE8 = 34

SQL QUERY:
select
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size,
	count(distinct ps_suppkey) as supplier_cnt
from
	partsupp,
	part
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and p_brand <> 'Brand#42'
	and p_type not like 'LARGE PLATED%'
	and p_size in (9, 7, 14, 41, 43, 38, 23, 34)
	and ps_suppkey not in (
		select
			s_suppkey
		from
			supplier
		where
			s_comment like '%Customer%Complaints%'
	)
group by
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size
order by
	supplier_cnt desc,
	p_brand,
	p_type,
	p_size;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines the top supplier so it can be rewarded, given more business, or identified for special recognition.
The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during a  given  quarter  of  a  given  year.  In  case  of  a  tie,  the  query lists  all  suppliers  whose  contribution  was  equal  to  the maximum, presented in supplier number order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the 10th  month of 1997. In this case assume DATE '1997-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
create view revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) as
	select
		l_suppkey,
		sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
	from
		lineitem
	where
		l_shipdate >= date '1997-01-01'
		and l_shipdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	group by
		l_suppkey;


select
	s_suppkey,
	s_name,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	total_revenue
from
	supplier,
	revenue0
where
	s_suppkey = supplier_no
	and total_revenue = (
		select
			max(total_revenue)
		from
			revenue0
	)
order by
	s_suppkey;

drop view revenue0;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This query retrieves the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value.
The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SEGMENT is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Segments in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume segment 'FURNITURE'
2. DATE is a randomly selected day within [1995-03-01 .. 1995-03-31]. In this case assume dates '1995-03-27', '1995-03-27'

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_orderkey,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE'
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate < date '1995-03-27'
	and l_shipdate > date '1995-03-27'
group by
	l_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
order by
	revenue desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 10;

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
This query lists the revenue volume done through local suppliers.
The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions  in  which  the  customer  ordering  parts  and  the  supplier  filling  them  were  both  within  that  nation.  The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given  year. The  query displays  the  nations and revenue  volume  in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1  - l_discount)).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in C;aise 4.2.3; In this case assume REGION 'EUROPE'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume 1994-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	n_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	supplier,
	nation,
	region
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and l_suppkey = s_suppkey
	and c_nationkey = s_nationkey
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'EUROPE'
	and o_orderdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	n_name
order by
	revenue desc;

QUESTION:
The  Large  Volume  Customer  Query  ranks  customers  based  on  their  having  placed  a  large  quantity  order.  Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level.
The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
