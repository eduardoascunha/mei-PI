Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how well the order priority system is working and gives an assessment of customer satisfaction.
The Order Priority Checking Query counts the number of orders ordered in a given quarter of a given year in which at least one lineitem  was received by the  customer later than its committed date. The  query lists the  count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the  10th  month  of 1997. In this case assume date '1997-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_orderpriority,
	count(*) as order_count
from
	orders
where
	o_orderdate >= date '1997-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	)
group by
	o_orderpriority
order by
	o_orderpriority;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query retrieves the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value.
The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SEGMENT is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Segments in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume segment 'FURNITURE'
2. DATE is a randomly selected day within [1995-03-01 .. 1995-03-31]. In this case assume dates '1995-03-27', '1995-03-27'

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_orderkey,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE'
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate < date '1995-03-27'
	and l_shipdate > date '1995-03-27'
group by
	l_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
order by
	revenue desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 10;

--- Example 3 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines the top supplier so it can be rewarded, given more business, or identified for special recognition.
The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during a  given  quarter  of  a  given  year.  In  case  of  a  tie,  the  query lists  all  suppliers  whose  contribution  was  equal  to  the maximum, presented in supplier number order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the 10th  month of 1997. In this case assume DATE '1997-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
create view revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) as
	select
		l_suppkey,
		sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
	from
		lineitem
	where
		l_shipdate >= date '1997-01-01'
		and l_shipdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	group by
		l_suppkey;


select
	s_suppkey,
	s_name,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	total_revenue
from
	supplier,
	revenue0
where
	s_suppkey = supplier_no
	and total_revenue = (
		select
			max(total_revenue)
		from
			revenue0
	)
order by
	s_suppkey;

drop view revenue0;

--- Example 4 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines the value of goods shipped between certain nations to help in the  re-negotiation of shipping 
contracts. 
The Volume  Shipping Query finds, for two given nations, the  gross discounted revenues derived from lineitems in which parts  were  shipped from a  supplier in either nation to a  customer in the  other nation during 1995 and 1996. The query lists the supplier nation, the customer nation, the year, and the revenue from shipments that took place  in that year. The query orders the answer by Supplier nation, Customer nation, and year (all ascending).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION1 'ARGENTINA'
2. NATION2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3 and must be different from the value selected for NATION1 in item 1 above. In this case assume NATION2 'KENYA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,
	l_year,
	sum(volume) as revenue
from
	(
		select
			n1.n_name as supp_nation,
			n2.n_name as cust_nation,
			extract(year from l_shipdate) as l_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) as volume
		from
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			orders,
			customer,
			nation n1,
			nation n2
		where
			s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
			and c_custkey = o_custkey
			and s_nationkey = n1.n_nationkey
			and c_nationkey = n2.n_nationkey
			and (
				(n1.n_name = 'ARGENTINA' and n2.n_name = 'KENYA')
				or (n1.n_name = 'KENYA' and n2.n_name = 'ARGENTINA')
			)
			and l_shipdate between date '1995-01-01' and date '1996-12-31'
	) as shipping
group by
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,
	l_year
order by
	supp_nation,
	cust_nation,
	l_year;

--- Example 5 ---
QUESTION:
This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. 
This query determines  the  distribution of customers by  the  number of orders they have  made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern. 
Substitution Parameters:
1. WORD1 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: special, pending, unusual, express. In this case assume WORD1 unusual
2. WORD2 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: packages, requests, accounts, deposits. In this case assume WORD2 accounts

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_count,
	count(*) as custdist
from
	(
		select
			c_custkey,
			count(o_orderkey)
		from
			customer left outer join orders on
				c_custkey = o_custkey
				and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
		group by
			c_custkey
	) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by
	c_count
order by
	custdist desc,
	c_count desc;

QUESTION:
This query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date.
The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in 
a given year, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for 
two  different  specified  ship  modes.  Only  lineitems  that  were  actually  shipped  before  the  l_commitdate  are  con-
sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a 
priority other than URGENT.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SHIPMODE1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume SHIPMODE1 'FOB'
2. SHIPMODE2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in  Clause  4.2.2.13 and must be different from the value selected for SHIPMODE1 in item 1; In this case assume SHIPMODE2 'MAIL'
3. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-01-01'
