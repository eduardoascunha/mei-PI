Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  quantifies  the  amount  of  revenue  increase  that  would  have  resulted  from  eliminating  certain  company-wide discounts in a given percentage range in a given year. Asking this type of "what if" query can be used to look for ways to increase revenues.
The Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped in a given year with discounts between DISCOUNT-0.01  and  DISCOUNT+0.01.  The  query  lists  the  amount  by  which  the  total  revenue  would  have increased  if  these  discounts  had  been  eliminated  for  lineitems  with  l_quantity  less  than  quantity.  Note  that  the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]; In this case assume DATE '1994-01-01'
2. DISCOUNT is randomly selected within [0.02 .. 0.09]; In this case assume DISCOUNT 0.02
3. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [24 .. 25]. In this case assume QUANTITY 25

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) as revenue
from
	lineitem
where
	l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
	and l_discount between 0.02 - 0.01 and 0.02 + 0.01
	and l_quantity < 25;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how well the order priority system is working and gives an assessment of customer satisfaction.
The Order Priority Checking Query counts the number of orders ordered in a given quarter of a given year in which at least one lineitem  was received by the  customer later than its committed date. The  query lists the  count of such orders for each order priority sorted in ascending priority order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the  10th  month  of 1997. In this case assume date '1997-01-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	o_orderpriority,
	count(*) as order_count
from
	orders
where
	o_orderdate >= date '1997-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_orderkey = o_orderkey
			and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	)
group by
	o_orderpriority
order by
	o_orderpriority;

--- Your Task ---
QUESTION:
This query monitors the market response to a promotion such as TV advertisements or a special campaign.
The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)). 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first day of a month randomly selected from a random year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-04-01'
