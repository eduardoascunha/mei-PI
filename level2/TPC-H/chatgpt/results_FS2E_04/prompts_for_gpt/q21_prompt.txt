Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_acctbal,
	s_name,
	n_name,
	p_partkey,
	p_mfgr,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	s_comment
from
	part,
	supplier,
	partsupp,
	nation,
	region
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
	and p_size = 2
	and p_type like '%TIN'
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'ASIA'
	and ps_supplycost = (
		select
			min(ps_supplycost)
		from
			partsupp,
			supplier,
			nation,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = ps_partkey
			and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'ASIA'
	)
order by
	s_acctbal desc,
	n_name,
	s_name,
	p_partkey
limit 100;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
The query identifies customers who might be having problems with the parts that are shipped to them.
The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter,  who  have  returned  parts.  The  query  considers  only  parts  that  were  ordered  in  the  specified  quarter.  The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. DATE is the first day of a randomly selected month from the second month of 1993 to the first month of 1995. In this case assume DATE '1993-08-01'

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	c_acctbal,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_phone,
	c_comment
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	nation
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate >= date '1993-08-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1993-08-01' + interval '3' month
	and l_returnflag = 'R'
	and c_nationkey = n_nationkey
group by
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	c_acctbal,
	c_phone,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_comment
order by
	revenue desc
limit 20;

--- Your Task ---
QUESTION:
This query identifies certain suppliers who were not able to ship required parts in a timely manner.
The Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a given nation, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order (with current status of 'F') where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date.
Return the first 100 selected rows
Substitution Parameters: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'ETHIOPIA'
