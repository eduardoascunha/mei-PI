Here are some examples of questions and their corresponding SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how much profit is made on a given line of parts, broken out by supplier nation and year.
The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the  sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount))  -  (ps_supplycost  * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the  year 
and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume COLOR '%red%'

SQL QUERY:
select
	nation,
	o_year,
	sum(amount) as sum_profit
from
	(
		select
			n_name as nation,
			extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity as amount
		from
			part,
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			partsupp,
			orders,
			nation
		where
			s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and ps_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and ps_partkey = l_partkey
			and p_partkey = l_partkey
			and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and p_name like '%red%'
	) as profit
group by
	nation,
	o_year
order by
	nation,
	o_year desc;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
The Global Sales Opportunity Query identifies geographies where there are customers who may be likely to make a purchase.
This query counts how many customers within a specific range of country codes have not placed orders for 7 years but  who  have  a  greater  than  average  “positive”  account  balance.  It  also  reflects  the magnitude  of  that  balance. Country code is defined as the first two characters of c_phone. 
Substitution Parameters: 
1. I1 ... I7 are randomly selected without repetition from the possible values for Country code as defined in Clause 4.2.2.9. In this case assume ('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')

SQL QUERY:
select
	cntrycode,
	count(*) as numcust,
	sum(c_acctbal) as totacctbal
from
	(
		select
			substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) as cntrycode,
			c_acctbal
		from
			customer
		where
			substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in
				('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')
			and c_acctbal > (
				select
					avg(c_acctbal)
				from
					customer
				where
					c_acctbal > 0.00
					and substring(c_phone from 1 for 2) in
						('30', '31', '28', '21', '26', '33', '10')
			)
			and not exists (
				select
					*
				from
					orders
				where
					o_custkey = c_custkey
			)
	) as custsale
group by
	cntrycode
order by
	cntrycode;

QUESTION:
This query determines how the market share of a given nation within a given region has changed over two years  for a given part type.
The  market  share  for  a  given  nation  within  a  given  region  is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  the  revenue,  the  sum  of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'KENYA'
2. REGION is the value defined in Clause 4.2.3 for R_NAME where R_REGIONKEY corresponds to N_REGIONKEY for the selected NATION in item 1 above; In this case assume REGION 'AFRICA'
3. TYPE is randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume TYPE 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'
