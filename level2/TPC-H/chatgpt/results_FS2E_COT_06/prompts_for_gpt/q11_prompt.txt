Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "cost supplier query finds", columns [partsupp.ps_supplycost] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "part in", columns [part.p_partkey, partsupp.ps_partkey] may be used.
According to "part s number", columns [part.p_mfgr, partsupp.ps_suppkey] may be used.
According to "part type", columns [part.p_type] may be used.
According to "part type and size", columns [part.p_size] may be used.
According to "region for", columns [nation.n_regionkey, region.r_name] may be used.
According to "region the", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "supplier s", columns [supplier.s_acctbal, supplier.s_comment, supplier.s_name, supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier s address", columns [supplier.s_address] may be used.
According to "supplier s address phone", columns [supplier.s_phone] may be used.
Values [%TIN, 2, ASIA] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_acctbal,
	s_name,
	n_name,
	p_partkey,
	p_mfgr,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	s_comment
from
	part,
	supplier,
	partsupp,
	nation,
	region
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
	and p_size = 2
	and p_type like '%TIN'
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'ASIA'
	and ps_supplycost = (
		select
			min(ps_supplycost)
		from
			partsupp,
			supplier,
			nation,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = ps_partkey
			and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'ASIA'
	)
order by
	s_acctbal desc,
	n_name,
	s_name,
	p_partkey
limit 100;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query identifies certain suppliers who were not able to ship required parts in a timely manner.
The Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a given nation, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order (with current status of 'F') where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date.
Return the first 100 selected rows
Substitution Parameters: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'ETHIOPIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "1 nation", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "date return", columns [lineitem.l_receiptdate] may be used.
According to "given nation", columns [nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "identifies suppliers for a", columns [supplier.s_name] may be used.
According to "order with", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order with current status", columns [orders.o_orderstatus] may be used.
According to "supplier who", columns [supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
Values [ETHIOPIA, F] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_name,
	count(*) as numwait
from
	supplier,
	lineitem l1,
	orders,
	nation
where
	s_suppkey = l1.l_suppkey
	and o_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
	and o_orderstatus = 'F'
	and l1.l_receiptdate > l1.l_commitdate
	and exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem l2
		where
			l2.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
			and l2.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
	)
	and not exists (
		select
			*
		from
			lineitem l3
		where
			l3.l_orderkey = l1.l_orderkey
			and l3.l_suppkey <> l1.l_suppkey
			and l3.l_receiptdate > l3.l_commitdate
	)
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'ETHIOPIA'
group by
	s_name
order by
	numwait desc,
	s_name
limit 100;

--- Your Task ---
QUESTION:
This query finds the most important subset of suppliers' stock in a given nation.
The Important Stock Identification Query finds, from scanning the available stock of suppliers in a given nation, all the parts that represent a significant 
percentage of the  total value of all available parts. The query displays the part number and the value of those parts in descending order of value.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'UNITED STATES'
2. FRACTION is chosen as 0.0001 / SF. In this case assume FRACTION 0.0001000000

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
