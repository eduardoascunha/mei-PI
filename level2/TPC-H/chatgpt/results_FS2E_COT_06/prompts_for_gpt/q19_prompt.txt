Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  determines  how  much  average  yearly  revenue  would  be  lost  if  orders  were  no longer  filled  for  small quantities of certain parts. This may reduce overhead expenses by concentrating sales on larger shipments.
The  Small-Quantity-Order  Revenue  Query  considers  parts  of  a  given  brand  and  with  a given  container  type  and determines the average lineitem quantity of such parts ordered for all orders (past and pending) in the 7 -year database. What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in revenue if orders for these parts with a quantity of less than 20% of this average were no longer taken?
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. BRAND = 'Brand#MN' where MN is a  two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]; In this case assume BRAND 'Brand#23'
2. CONTAINER  is  randomly  selected  within  the  list  of  2-syllable  strings  defined  for Containers  in  Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume CONTAINER 'SM CAN'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given container type", columns [part.p_container] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice, lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "lineitem quantity of", columns [lineitem.l_partkey] may be used.
According to "parts with", columns [part.p_brand, part.p_partkey] may be used.
Values [0.2, 7.0, Brand#23, SM CAN] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice) / 7.0 as avg_yearly
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	p_partkey = l_partkey
	and p_brand = 'Brand#23'
	and p_container = 'SM CAN'
	and l_quantity < (
		select
			0.2 * avg(l_quantity)
		from
			lineitem
		where
			l_partkey = p_partkey
	);

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query monitors the market response to a promotion such as TV advertisements or a special campaign.
The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)). 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first day of a month randomly selected from a random year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-04-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "as l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "parts the", columns [part.p_partkey, part.p_type] may be used.
According to "shipped in that month", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
Values [1, 100.00, 1996-04-01, PROMO%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	100.00 * sum(case
		when p_type like 'PROMO%'
			then l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)
		else 0
	end) / sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as promo_revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	l_partkey = p_partkey
	and l_shipdate >= date '1996-04-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1996-04-01' + interval '1' month;

QUESTION:
The Discounted Revenue Query reports the gross discounted revenue attributed to the sale of selected parts handled in  a  particular  manner. This  query  is  an  example  of  code  such  as  might be  produced  programmatically  by  a  data mining tool.
The  Discounted  Revenue  query  finds  the  gross  discounted  revenue  for  all  orders  for three  different  types  of  parts that  were  shipped by air  and  delivered in person. Parts are selected based on the  combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes.
Substitution Parameters:
1. QUANTITY1 is randomly selected within [1..10]. In this case assume QUANTITY1 = 4
2. QUANTITY2 is randomly selected within [10..20]. In this case assume QUANTITY2 = 16
3. QUANTITY3 is randomly selected within [20..30]. In this case assume QUANTITY3 = 29
4. BRAND1, BRAND2, BRAND3 = 'Brand#MN' where each MN is a two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]. In this case assume BRAND1 = 'Brand#11' , BRAND2 = 'Brand#25' , BRAND3 = 'Brand#54'

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
