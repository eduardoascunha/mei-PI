Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. 
This query determines  the  distribution of customers by  the  number of orders they have  made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern. 
Substitution Parameters:
1. WORD1 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: special, pending, unusual, express. In this case assume WORD1 unusual
2. WORD2 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: packages, requests, accounts, deposits. In this case assume WORD2 accounts

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "customers who", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "order comment", columns [orders.o_comment] may be used.
According to "orders how", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "orders special", columns [orders.o_custkey] may be used.
Values [%unusual%accounts%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_count,
	count(*) as custdist
from
	(
		select
			c_custkey,
			count(o_orderkey)
		from
			customer left outer join orders on
				c_custkey = o_custkey
				and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
		group by
			c_custkey
	) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by
	c_count
order by
	custdist desc,
	c_count desc;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines the top supplier so it can be rewarded, given more business, or identified for special recognition.
The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during a  given  quarter  of  a  given  year.  In  case  of  a  tie,  the  query lists  all  suppliers  whose  contribution  was  equal  to  the maximum, presented in supplier number order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the 10th  month of 1997. In this case assume DATE '1997-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "shipped during a given", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "supplier number", columns [supplier.s_phone, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier query finds the", columns [supplier.s_address, supplier.s_name] may be used.
Values [1997-01-01, 3] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
create view revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) as
	select
		l_suppkey,
		sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
	from
		lineitem
	where
		l_shipdate >= date '1997-01-01'
		and l_shipdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	group by
		l_suppkey;


select
	s_suppkey,
	s_name,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	total_revenue
from
	supplier,
	revenue0
where
	s_suppkey = supplier_no
	and total_revenue = (
		select
			max(total_revenue)
		from
			revenue0
	)
order by
	s_suppkey;

drop view revenue0;

--- Your Task ---
QUESTION:
The  Large  Volume  Customer  Query  ranks  customers  based  on  their  having  placed  a  large  quantity  order.  Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level.
The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [312..315]. In this case assume QUANTITY = 314

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
