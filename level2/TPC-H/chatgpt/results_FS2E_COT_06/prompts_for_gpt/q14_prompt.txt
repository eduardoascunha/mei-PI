Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This  query  quantifies  the  amount  of  revenue  increase  that  would  have  resulted  from  eliminating  certain  company-wide discounts in a given percentage range in a given year. Asking this type of "what if" query can be used to look for ways to increase revenues.
The Forecasting Revenue Change Query considers all the lineitems shipped in a given year with discounts between DISCOUNT-0.01  and  DISCOUNT+0.01.  The  query  lists  the  amount  by  which  the  total  revenue  would  have increased  if  these  discounts  had  been  eliminated  for  lineitems  with  l_quantity  less  than  quantity.  Note  that  the potential revenue increase is equal to the sum of [l_extendedprice * l_discount] for all lineitems with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]; In this case assume DATE '1994-01-01'
2. DISCOUNT is randomly selected within [0.02 .. 0.09]; In this case assume DISCOUNT 0.02
3. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [24 .. 25]. In this case assume QUANTITY 25

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "l_discount for all lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "lineitems shipped in", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "lineitems with l_quantity", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "of l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
Values [0.01, 0.02, 1, 1994-01-01, 25] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice * l_discount) as revenue
from
	lineitem
where
	l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and l_shipdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
	and l_discount between 0.02 - 0.01 and 0.02 + 0.01
	and l_quantity < 25;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
The Potential Part Promotion Query identifies suppliers in a particular nation having selected parts that may be candidates for a promotional offer.
The  Potential Part Promotion  query identifies suppliers  who have an excess of a  given part available; an excess is defined  to  be  more  than  50%  of  the  parts  like  the  given  part  that  the  supplier shipped  in  a  given  year  for  a  given nation. Only parts whose names share a certain naming convention are considered.
Substitution Parameters:
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME. In this case assume COLOR 'brown%'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within 1993..1997. In this case assume DATE '1994-01-01'
3. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'SAUDI ARABIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "given nation", columns [nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "given part available", columns [partsupp.ps_availqty] may be used.
According to "identifies suppliers in a", columns [supplier.s_name] may be used.
According to "nation only", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "p_name in this case", columns [part.p_name] may be used.
According to "part promotion query identifies", columns [partsupp.ps_partkey, partsupp.ps_suppkey] may be used.
According to "parts whose names", columns [part.p_partkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers in a particular", columns [supplier.s_address, supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
Values [0.5, 1, 1994-01-01, SAUDI ARABIA, brown%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_name,
	s_address
from
	supplier,
	nation
where
	s_suppkey in (
		select
			ps_suppkey
		from
			partsupp
		where
			ps_partkey in (
				select
					p_partkey
				from
					part
				where
					p_name like 'brown%'
			)
			and ps_availqty > (
				select
					0.5 * sum(l_quantity)
				from
					lineitem
				where
					l_partkey = ps_partkey
					and l_suppkey = ps_suppkey
					and l_shipdate >= date '1994-01-01'
					and l_shipdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
			)
	)
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA'
order by
	s_name;

--- Your Task ---
QUESTION:
This query monitors the market response to a promotion such as TV advertisements or a special campaign.
The Promotion Effect Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)). 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE is the first day of a month randomly selected from a random year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-04-01'
