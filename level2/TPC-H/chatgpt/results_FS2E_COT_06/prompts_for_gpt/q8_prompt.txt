Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how much profit is made on a given line of parts, broken out by supplier nation and year.
The Product Type Profit Measure Query finds, for each nation and each year, the profit for all parts ordered in that year that contain a specified substring in their names and that were filled by a supplier in that nation. The profit is defined as the  sum of [(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount))  -  (ps_supplycost  * l_quantity)] for all lineitems describing parts in the specified line. The query lists the nations in ascending alphabetical order and, for each nation, the  year 
and profit in descending order by year (most recent first).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. COLOR is randomly selected within the list of values defined for the generation of P_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume COLOR '%red%'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "for all lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_suppkey] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "l_quantity for all lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "lineitems describing parts in", columns [lineitem.l_partkey] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "of l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "order and", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "ordered in that year", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "p_name in", columns [part.p_name] may be used.
According to "parts in the specified", columns [part.p_partkey, partsupp.ps_partkey] may be used.
According to "ps_supplycost l_quantity", columns [partsupp.ps_suppkey, partsupp.ps_supplycost] may be used.
According to "supplier in", columns [supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier nation and", columns [supplier.s_nationkey] may be used.
Values [%red%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	nation,
	o_year,
	sum(amount) as sum_profit
from
	(
		select
			n_name as nation,
			extract(year from o_orderdate) as o_year,
			l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount) - ps_supplycost * l_quantity as amount
		from
			part,
			supplier,
			lineitem,
			partsupp,
			orders,
			nation
		where
			s_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and ps_suppkey = l_suppkey
			and ps_partkey = l_partkey
			and p_partkey = l_partkey
			and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and p_name like '%red%'
	) as profit
group by
	nation,
	o_year
order by
	nation,
	o_year desc;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
This query finds which supplier should be selected to place an order for a given part in a given region.
The Minimum Cost Supplier Query finds, in a given region, for each part of a certain type and size, the supplier who can  supply  it  at  minimum  cost.  If  several  suppliers  in  that  region  offer  the  desired  part  type  and  size  at  the  same (minimum)  cost,  the  query  lists  the  parts  from  suppliers  with  the  100  highest  account  balances.  For  each  supplier, the  query  lists  the  supplier's  account  balance,  name  and  nation;  the  part's  number  and  manufacturer;  the  supplier's address, phone number and comment information.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. SIZE is randomly selected within [1. 50]; In this case assume SIZE 2
2. TYPE is randomly selected within the list Syllable 3 defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume type '%TIN'
3. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in 4.2.3. In this case assume REGION 'ASIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "cost supplier query finds", columns [partsupp.ps_supplycost] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "part in", columns [part.p_partkey, partsupp.ps_partkey] may be used.
According to "part s number", columns [part.p_mfgr, partsupp.ps_suppkey] may be used.
According to "part type", columns [part.p_type] may be used.
According to "part type and size", columns [part.p_size] may be used.
According to "region for", columns [nation.n_regionkey, region.r_name] may be used.
According to "region the", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "supplier s", columns [supplier.s_acctbal, supplier.s_comment, supplier.s_name, supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier s address", columns [supplier.s_address] may be used.
According to "supplier s address phone", columns [supplier.s_phone] may be used.
Values [%TIN, 2, ASIA] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	s_acctbal,
	s_name,
	n_name,
	p_partkey,
	p_mfgr,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	s_comment
from
	part,
	supplier,
	partsupp,
	nation,
	region
where
	p_partkey = ps_partkey
	and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
	and p_size = 2
	and p_type like '%TIN'
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'ASIA'
	and ps_supplycost = (
		select
			min(ps_supplycost)
		from
			partsupp,
			supplier,
			nation,
			region
		where
			p_partkey = ps_partkey
			and s_suppkey = ps_suppkey
			and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
			and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
			and r_name = 'ASIA'
	)
order by
	s_acctbal desc,
	n_name,
	s_name,
	p_partkey
limit 100;

--- Your Task ---
QUESTION:
This query determines how the market share of a given nation within a given region has changed over two years  for a given part type.
The  market  share  for  a  given  nation  within  a  given  region  is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  the  revenue,  the  sum  of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'KENYA'
2. REGION is the value defined in Clause 4.2.3 for R_NAME where R_REGIONKEY corresponds to N_REGIONKEY for the selected NATION in item 1 above; In this case assume REGION 'AFRICA'
3. TYPE is randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume TYPE 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'

Think step by step and then return ONLY the SQL query:
