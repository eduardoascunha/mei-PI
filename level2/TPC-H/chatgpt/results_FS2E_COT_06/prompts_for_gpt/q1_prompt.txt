Here are some examples of questions with chain-of-thought reasoning and their SQL queries:

--- Example 1 ---
QUESTION:
This query retrieves the 10 unshipped orders with the highest value.
The Shipping Priority Query retrieves the shipping priority and potential revenue, defined as the sum of l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount), of the orders having the largest revenue among those that had not been shipped as of a given date. Orders are listed in decreasing order of revenue. If more than 10 unshipped orders exist, only the 10 orders with the largest revenue are listed.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SEGMENT is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Segments in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume segment 'FURNITURE'
2. DATE is a randomly selected day within [1995-03-01 .. 1995-03-31]. In this case assume dates '1995-03-27', '1995-03-27'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "date orders", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "date orders are listed", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "l_discount of", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "of l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "orders are listed in", columns [orders.o_shippriority] may be used.
According to "orders with", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "orders with the highest", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
Values [1995-03-27, FURNITURE] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_orderkey,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	c_mktsegment = 'FURNITURE'
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate < date '1995-03-27'
	and l_shipdate > date '1995-03-27'
group by
	l_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_shippriority
order by
	revenue desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 10;

--- Example 2 ---
QUESTION:
The query identifies customers who might be having problems with the parts that are shipped to them.
The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter,  who  have  returned  parts.  The  query  considers  only  parts  that  were  ordered  in  the  specified  quarter.  The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:
1. DATE is the first day of a randomly selected month from the second month of 1993 to the first month of 1995. In this case assume DATE '1993-08-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "address nation", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "comment information and", columns [customer.c_comment] may be used.
According to "customer s name", columns [customer.c_name, customer.c_phone] may be used.
According to "customer s name address", columns [customer.c_acctbal, customer.c_address, customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "l_discount for", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "lineitems substitution", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_returnflag] may be used.
According to "name address nation", columns [customer.c_nationkey, nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "order of", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderdate, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
Values [1993-08-01, 3, R] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue,
	c_acctbal,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_phone,
	c_comment
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	nation
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and o_orderdate >= date '1993-08-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1993-08-01' + interval '3' month
	and l_returnflag = 'R'
	and c_nationkey = n_nationkey
group by
	c_custkey,
	c_name,
	c_acctbal,
	c_phone,
	n_name,
	c_address,
	c_comment
order by
	revenue desc
limit 20;

--- Your Task ---
QUESTION:
This query reports the amount of business that was billed, shipped, and returned. 
The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped as of a given date. The  date  is  within  60  -  120  days  of  the  greatest  ship  date  contained  in  the  database.  The  query  lists  totals  for extended  price,  discounted  extended  price,  discounted  extended  price  plus  tax,  average  quantity,  average  extended price,  and  average  discount.  These  aggregates  are  grouped  by  RETURNFLAG  and  LINESTATUS,  and  listed  in  ascending  order  of  RETURNFLAG  and  LINESTATUS.  A  count  of  the  number  of  lineitems  in  each  group  is included. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:  
1. DELTA is randomly selected within [60. 120]. In this case assume DELTA = '84 days'
Comment: 1998-12-01 is the highest possible ship date as defined in the database population. (This is ENDDATE - 30).  The  query  will  include  all  lineitems  shipped  before  this  date  minus  DELTA  days.  The  intent  is  to  choose DELTA so that between 95% and 97% of the rows in the table are scanned.
