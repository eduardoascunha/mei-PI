QUESTION:
This query lists the revenue volume done through local suppliers.
The Local Supplier Volume Query lists for each nation in a region the revenue  volume that resulted from lineitem transactions  in  which  the  customer  ordering  parts  and  the  supplier  filling  them  were  both  within  that  nation.  The query is run in order to determine whether to institute local distribution centers in a given region. The query considers only parts ordered in a given  year. The  query displays  the  nations and revenue  volume  in descending order by revenue. Revenue volume for all qualifying lineitems in a particular nation is defined as sum(l_extendedprice * (1  - l_discount)).
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. REGION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for R_NAME in C;aise 4.2.3; In this case assume REGION 'EUROPE'
2. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume 1994-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "l_extendedprice 1", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "l_extendedprice 1 l_discount", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "lineitems in", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, lineitem.l_suppkey] may be used.
According to "nation in a region", columns [nation.n_regionkey] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "order to", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderdate, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "particular nation is defined", columns [customer.c_nationkey] may be used.
According to "region is", columns [region.r_name] may be used.
According to "region the", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers the", columns [supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers the local supplier", columns [supplier.s_nationkey] may be used.
Values [1, 1994-01-01, EUROPE] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	n_name,
	sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem,
	supplier,
	nation,
	region
where
	c_custkey = o_custkey
	and l_orderkey = o_orderkey
	and l_suppkey = s_suppkey
	and c_nationkey = s_nationkey
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_regionkey = r_regionkey
	and r_name = 'EUROPE'
	and o_orderdate >= date '1994-01-01'
	and o_orderdate < date '1994-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	n_name
order by
	revenue desc;
