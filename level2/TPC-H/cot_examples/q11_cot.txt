QUESTION:
This query finds the most important subset of suppliers' stock in a given nation.
The Important Stock Identification Query finds, from scanning the available stock of suppliers in a given nation, all the parts that represent a significant 
percentage of the  total value of all available parts. The query displays the part number and the value of those parts in descending order of value.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'UNITED STATES'
2. FRACTION is chosen as 0.0001 / SF. In this case assume FRACTION 0.0001000000

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "available parts the query", columns [partsupp.ps_availqty] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "of all available parts", columns [partsupp.ps_supplycost] may be used.
According to "of suppliers", columns [supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "parts in", columns [partsupp.ps_suppkey] may be used.
According to "query displays the part", columns [partsupp.ps_partkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers in", columns [supplier.s_nationkey] may be used.
Values [0.0001000000, UNITED STATES] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	ps_partkey,
	sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) as value
from
	partsupp,
	supplier,
	nation
where
	ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
	and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
	and n_name = 'UNITED STATES'
group by
	ps_partkey having
		sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) > (
			select
				sum(ps_supplycost * ps_availqty) * 0.0001000000
			from
				partsupp,
				supplier,
				nation
			where
				ps_suppkey = s_suppkey
				and s_nationkey = n_nationkey
				and n_name = 'UNITED STATES'
		)
order by
	value desc;
