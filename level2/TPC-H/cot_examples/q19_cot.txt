QUESTION:
The Discounted Revenue Query reports the gross discounted revenue attributed to the sale of selected parts handled in  a  particular  manner. This  query  is  an  example  of  code  such  as  might be  produced  programmatically  by  a  data mining tool.
The  Discounted  Revenue  query  finds  the  gross  discounted  revenue  for  all  orders  for three  different  types  of  parts that  were  shipped by air  and  delivered in person. Parts are selected based on the  combination of specific brands, a list of containers, and a range of sizes.
Substitution Parameters:
1. QUANTITY1 is randomly selected within [1..10]. In this case assume QUANTITY1 = 4
2. QUANTITY2 is randomly selected within [10..20]. In this case assume QUANTITY2 = 16
3. QUANTITY3 is randomly selected within [20..30]. In this case assume QUANTITY3 = 29
4. BRAND1, BRAND2, BRAND3 = 'Brand#MN' where each MN is a two character string representing two numbers randomly and independently selected within [1 .. 5]. In this case assume BRAND1 = 'Brand#11' , BRAND2 = 'Brand#25' , BRAND3 = 'Brand#54'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "brand 25 brand3", columns [part.p_brand] may be used.
According to "containers and", columns [part.p_container] may be used.
According to "discounted revenue query finds", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "parts are selected based", columns [part.p_partkey] may be used.
According to "quantity1 is", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
According to "selected parts handled in", columns [lineitem.l_partkey] may be used.
According to "sizes substitution parameters 1", columns [part.p_size] may be used.
Values [10, 15, 16, 29, 4, 5, AIR, AIR REG, Brand#11, Brand#25, Brand#54, DELIVER IN PERSON, LG BOX, LG CASE, LG PACK, LG PKG, MED BAG, MED BOX, MED PACK, MED PKG, SM BOX, SM CASE, SM PACK, SM PKG] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	sum(l_extendedprice* (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
	lineitem,
	part
where
	(
		p_partkey = l_partkey
		and p_brand = 'Brand#11'
		and p_container in ('SM CASE', 'SM BOX', 'SM PACK', 'SM PKG')
		and l_quantity >= 4 and l_quantity <= 4 + 10
		and p_size between 1 and 5
		and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
		and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
	)
	or
	(
		p_partkey = l_partkey
		and p_brand = 'Brand#25'
		and p_container in ('MED BAG', 'MED BOX', 'MED PKG', 'MED PACK')
		and l_quantity >= 16 and l_quantity <= 16 + 10
		and p_size between 1 and 10
		and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
		and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
	)
	or
	(
		p_partkey = l_partkey
		and p_brand = 'Brand#54'
		and p_container in ('LG CASE', 'LG BOX', 'LG PACK', 'LG PKG')
		and l_quantity >= 29 and l_quantity <= 29 + 10
		and p_size between 1 and 15
		and l_shipmode in ('AIR', 'AIR REG')
		and l_shipinstruct = 'DELIVER IN PERSON'
	);
