QUESTION:
This query identifies certain suppliers who were not able to ship required parts in a timely manner.
The Suppliers Who Kept Orders Waiting query identifies suppliers, for a given nation, whose product was part of a multi-supplier order (with current status of 'F') where they were the only supplier who failed to meet the committed delivery date.
Return the first 100 selected rows
Substitution Parameters: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3. In this case assume NATION 'ETHIOPIA'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "1 nation", columns [nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "date return", columns [lineitem.l_receiptdate] may be used.
According to "given nation", columns [nation.n_name] may be used.
According to "identifies suppliers for a", columns [supplier.s_name] may be used.
According to "order with", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order with current status", columns [orders.o_orderstatus] may be used.
According to "supplier who", columns [supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
Values [ETHIOPIA, F] may be used.
So the final answer is:
