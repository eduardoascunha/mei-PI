QUESTION:
This query seeks relationships between customers and the size of their orders. 
This query determines  the  distribution of customers by  the  number of orders they have  made, including customers who have no record of orders, past or present. It counts and reports how many customers have no orders, how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the orders counted do not fall into one of several special categories of orders. Special categories are identified in the order comment column by looking for a particular pattern. 
Substitution Parameters:
1. WORD1 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: special, pending, unusual, express. In this case assume WORD1 unusual
2. WORD2 is randomly selected from 4 possible values: packages, requests, accounts, deposits. In this case assume WORD2 accounts

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "customers who", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "order comment", columns [orders.o_comment] may be used.
According to "orders how", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "orders special", columns [orders.o_custkey] may be used.
Values [%unusual%accounts%] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_count,
	count(*) as custdist
from
	(
		select
			c_custkey,
			count(o_orderkey)
		from
			customer left outer join orders on
				c_custkey = o_custkey
				and o_comment not like '%unusual%accounts%'
		group by
			c_custkey
	) as c_orders (c_custkey, c_count)
group by
	c_count
order by
	custdist desc,
	c_count desc;
