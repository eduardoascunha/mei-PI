QUESTION:
This query determines how the market share of a given nation within a given region has changed over two years  for a given part type.
The  market  share  for  a  given  nation  within  a  given  region  is  defined  as  the  fraction  of  the  revenue,  the  sum  of [l_extendedprice * (1-l_discount)], from the products of a specified type in that region that was supplied by suppliers from the given nation. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. NATION is randomly selected within the list of values defined for N_NAME in Clause 4.2.3; In this case assume NATION 'KENYA'
2. REGION is the value defined in Clause 4.2.3 for R_NAME where R_REGIONKEY corresponds to N_REGIONKEY for the selected NATION in item 1 above; In this case assume REGION 'AFRICA'
3. TYPE is randomly selected within the list of 3-syllable strings defined for Types in Clause 4.2.2.13. In this case assume TYPE 'ECONOMY PLATED BRASS'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "corresponds to n_regionkey", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "given part type", columns [lineitem.l_partkey, part.p_partkey, part.p_type] may be used.
According to "l_discount from the", columns [lineitem.l_discount] may be used.
According to "nation the", columns [nation.n_name, nation.n_nationkey] may be used.
According to "of l_extendedprice", columns [lineitem.l_extendedprice] may be used.
According to "r_name where r_regionkey corresponds", columns [region.r_name] may be used.
According to "r_regionkey corresponds to", columns [region.r_regionkey] may be used.
According to "suppliers from the given", columns [supplier.s_nationkey, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "this order", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey, orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderdate, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "to n_regionkey", columns [customer.c_nationkey, nation.n_regionkey] may be used.
Values [1995-01-01, 1996-12-31, AFRICA, ECONOMY PLATED BRASS, KENYA] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:

	o_year,
	sum(case
