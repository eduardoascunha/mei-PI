QUESTION:
This query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date.
The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in 
a given year, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for 
two  different  specified  ship  modes.  Only  lineitems  that  were  actually  shipped  before  the  l_commitdate  are  con-
sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a 
priority other than URGENT.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SHIPMODE1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume SHIPMODE1 'FOB'
2. SHIPMODE2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in  Clause  4.2.2.13 and must be different from the value selected for SHIPMODE1 in item 1; In this case assume SHIPMODE2 'MAIL'
3. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "belonging to orders for", columns [orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "for lineitems actually received", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "l_commitdate for", columns [lineitem.l_commitdate] may be used.
According to "l_receiptdate exceeds the", columns [lineitem.l_receiptdate] may be used.
According to "lineitems belonging to orders", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order priority query", columns [orders.o_orderpriority] may be used.
According to "ship mode for lineitems", columns [lineitem.l_shipmode] may be used.
Values [1, 1-URGENT, 1996-01-01, 2-HIGH, FOB, MAIL] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	l_shipmode,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority = '1-URGENT'
			or o_orderpriority = '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as high_line_count,
	sum(case
		when o_orderpriority <> '1-URGENT'
			and o_orderpriority <> '2-HIGH'
			then 1
		else 0
	end) as low_line_count
from
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey = l_orderkey
	and l_shipmode in ('FOB', 'MAIL')
	and l_commitdate < l_receiptdate
	and l_shipdate < l_commitdate
	and l_receiptdate >= date '1996-01-01'
	and l_receiptdate < date '1996-01-01' + interval '1' year
group by
	l_shipmode
order by
	l_shipmode;
