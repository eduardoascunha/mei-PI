QUESTION:
The  Large  Volume  Customer  Query  ranks  customers  based  on  their  having  placed  a  large  quantity  order.  Large quantity orders are defined as those orders whose total quantity is above a certain level.
The Large Volume Customer Query finds a list of the top 100 customers who have ever placed large quantity orders. The query lists the customer name, customer key, the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. QUANTITY is randomly selected within [312..315]. In this case assume QUANTITY = 314

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "customer key the", columns [customer.c_custkey] may be used.
According to "customer name customer", columns [customer.c_name] may be used.
According to "key the order key", columns [lineitem.l_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order key", columns [orders.o_custkey, orders.o_orderkey] may be used.
According to "order key date", columns [orders.o_orderdate] may be used.
According to "orders whose total", columns [orders.o_totalprice] may be used.
According to "text 1 quantity is", columns [lineitem.l_quantity] may be used.
Values [314] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
select
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice,
	sum(l_quantity)
from
	customer,
	orders,
	lineitem
where
	o_orderkey in (
		select
			l_orderkey
		from
			lineitem
		group by
			l_orderkey having
				sum(l_quantity) > 314
	)
	and c_custkey = o_custkey
	and o_orderkey = l_orderkey
group by
	c_name,
	c_custkey,
	o_orderkey,
	o_orderdate,
	o_totalprice
order by
	o_totalprice desc,
	o_orderdate
limit 100;
