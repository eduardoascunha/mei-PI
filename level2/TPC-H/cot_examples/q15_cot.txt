QUESTION:
This query determines the top supplier so it can be rewarded, given more business, or identified for special recognition.
The Top Supplier Query finds the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during a  given  quarter  of  a  given  year.  In  case  of  a  tie,  the  query lists  all  suppliers  whose  contribution  was  equal  to  the maximum, presented in supplier number order. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. DATE  is  the  first  day  of  a  randomly  selected  month  between  the  first  month  of  1993  and  the 10th  month of 1997. In this case assume DATE '1997-01-01'

CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
Let's think step by step.
According to "shipped during a given", columns [lineitem.l_shipdate] may be used.
According to "supplier number", columns [supplier.s_phone, supplier.s_suppkey] may be used.
According to "supplier query finds the", columns [supplier.s_address, supplier.s_name] may be used.
Values [1997-01-01, 3] may be used.
So the final answer is:

SQL QUERY:
create view revenue0 (supplier_no, total_revenue) as
	select
		l_suppkey,
		sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount))
	from
		lineitem
	where
		l_shipdate >= date '1997-01-01'
		and l_shipdate < date '1997-01-01' + interval '3' month
	group by
		l_suppkey;


select
	s_suppkey,
	s_name,
	s_address,
	s_phone,
	total_revenue
from
	supplier,
	revenue0
where
	s_suppkey = supplier_no
	and total_revenue = (
		select
			max(total_revenue)
		from
			revenue0
	)
order by
	s_suppkey;

drop view revenue0;
