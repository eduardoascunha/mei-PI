This query reports the amount of business that was billed, shipped, and returned. 
The Pricing Summary Report Query provides a summary pricing report for all lineitems shipped as of a given date. The  date  is  within  60  -  120  days  of  the  greatest  ship  date  contained  in  the  database.  The  query  lists  totals  for extended  price,  discounted  extended  price,  discounted  extended  price  plus  tax,  average  quantity,  average  extended price,  and  average  discount.  These  aggregates  are  grouped  by  RETURNFLAG  and  LINESTATUS,  and  listed  in  ascending  order  of  RETURNFLAG  and  LINESTATUS.  A  count  of  the  number  of  lineitems  in  each  group  is included. 
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameter must be generated and used to build the executable query text:  
1. DELTA is randomly selected within [60. 120]. In this case assume DELTA = '84 days'
Comment: 1998-12-01 is the highest possible ship date as defined in the database population. (This is ENDDATE - 30).  The  query  will  include  all  lineitems  shipped  before  this  date  minus  DELTA  days.  The  intent  is  to  choose DELTA so that between 95% and 97% of the rows in the table are scanned.
