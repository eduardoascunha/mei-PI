The Returned Item Reporting Query finds the top 20 customers, in terms of their effect on lost revenue for a given quarter,  who  have  returned  parts.  The  query  considers  only  parts  that  were  ordered  in  the  specified  quarter.  The query lists the customer's name, address, nation, phone number, account balance, comment information and revenue lost. The customers are listed in descending order of lost revenue. Revenue lost is defined as sum(l_extendedprice*(1-l_discount)) for all qualifying lineitems.
