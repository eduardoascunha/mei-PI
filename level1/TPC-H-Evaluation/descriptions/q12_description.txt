This query determines whether selecting less expensive modes of shipping is negatively affecting the critical-priority orders by causing more parts to be received by customers after the committed date.
The Shipping Modes and Order Priority Query counts, by ship mode, for lineitems actually received by customers in 
a given year, the number of lineitems belonging to orders for which the l_receiptdate exceeds the l_commitdate for 
two  different  specified  ship  modes.  Only  lineitems  that  were  actually  shipped  before  the  l_commitdate  are  con-
sidered. The late lineitems are partitioned into two groups, those with priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a 
priority other than URGENT.
Substitution Parameters: Values for the following substitution parameters must be generated and used to build the executable query text: 
1. SHIPMODE1 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in Clause 4.2.2.13; In this case assume SHIPMODE1 'FOB'
2. SHIPMODE2 is randomly selected within the list of values defined for Modes in  Clause  4.2.2.13 and must be different from the value selected for SHIPMODE1 in item 1; In this case assume SHIPMODE2 'MAIL'
3. DATE is the first of January of a randomly selected year within [1993 .. 1997]. In this case assume DATE '1996-01-01'
